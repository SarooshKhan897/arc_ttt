The projectile fires from the corner diagonally opposite the opening, in the direction from the opening toward that opposite corner, for 5 steps. For V-shapes (which span a 2x3 or 3x2 area), the apex pixel fires in the direction perpendicular to the base, 5 cells away. Projectiles landing on empty space become maroon(9); two projectiles colliding on the same empty cell become blue(1); a projectile hitting an existing shape recolors that shape to maroon(9).\n",

            "Reasoning: Hypothesis 1 is the most comprehensive and handles the different cases. However, I need to refine the tiling range for the aligned-singleton case. Let me think more carefully about this. In Ex1 row 8: pattern 9 at cols 0,2 (period 2, phase 0), singleton 6 at col 6. Output: 6 at cols 0,2,4,6. The tiling goes from col 0 to col 6 (the max of all non-zero positions). In Ex1 row 11: pattern 8 at cols 0,1 (period 1, phase 0), singleton 3 at col 7. Output: 3 at cols 0-7. The tiling goes from col 0 to col 7. In Ex2 col 2: pattern green at rows 5,8 (period 3, phase 2), singleton yellow at row 2. Row 2 mod 3 = 2, so aligned. Output: yellow at rows 2,5,8. The tiling covers the full column... but wait, it only has cells at 2,5,8 which happens to be the full extent. In Ex2 col 18: pattern maroon at rows 6,8 (period 2, phase 0), singleton gray at row 3. Row 3 mod 2 = 1, not aligned. Output: maroon at 0,2,4,6,8 and gray at 3. Pattern tiled across entire column, singleton preserved. So the key question is: for aligned singletons, is the tiling bounded or full? In Ex2 col 2, the result is yellow at 2,5,8 - this IS the full column tiling at period 3 phase 2 (0 would be -1, so first valid is 2). So maybe aligned singletons DO tile the full line, just with replaced color. Let me check Ex1 row 8: if full tiling at period 2 phase 0 with color 6, that would give cols 0,2,4,6,8. But output has col 8 as 0. Hmm. So the tiling IS bounded. Range = [0, 6] where 6 is the max non-zero position. For row 11: full tiling period 1 gives cols 0-8, but output has 0-7. Range = [0, 7] where 7 is max non-zero position. So for aligned singletons: replace color AND bound tiling to [min, max] of all non-zero cells. For non-aligned singletons (Ex2 col 18): tile pattern across ENTIRE line, keep singleton. This is essentially a hybrid of hypotheses 1 and 2. Let me adopt this refined version.\"}\n",

            "Reasoning: Hypothesis 1 is mostly correct but I need to reconcile the tiling range issue. Let me think more carefully. The issue is: when a singleton aligns, does tiling go from 0 to singleton_pos, or across the full line? Example 2 col 2 shows it goes across the full line (yellow at 2,5,8 - not limited to 0..2). But Example 1 row 8 seems limited to 0..6 (stopping at singleton pos 6, not including pos 8). Wait - maybe the tiling goes from the minimum pattern cell position to the maximum non-zero cell position? In Example 1 row 8: min pattern pos = 0, max non-zero pos = 6 (the singleton). Range [0,6], giving 0,2,4,6. Row 11: min pattern pos = 0, max non-zero pos = 7 (singleton). Range [0,7], giving 0,1,...,7. Row 1: min pos = 0, max pos = 3. Range [0,3], giving 0,3. But output has 0,3,6! So that doesn't work either. Let me reconsider. For rows without singletons, the tiling extends across the full line. For rows with singletons... Actually, in row 1 there's no singleton, and it tiles 0,3,6 (full line). In row 4, no singleton, tiles 0-8 (full line). In row 8, singleton aligned: tiles 0,2,4,6 but not 8. In row 11, singleton aligned: tiles 0-7 but not 8. Hmm, in both singleton-aligned cases in Example 1, the last column (8) is empty. What if when a singleton replaces the pattern, the resulting tiling fills the SAME positions as the original pattern would have if tiled to fill 0..max_original_position AND the singleton adds more? No... Let me look at this differently. Maybe the key is: the pattern cells define specific positions, and the singleton adds one more repetition. Row 8: maroon at 0,2. Adding one more: 0,2,4. But we get 0,2,4,6. That's adding TWO more. Hmm. Or maybe: tile pattern fully from 0 to line_end, but if singleton aligns, the pattern only extends up to singleton position. Row 8: tile period 2, phase 0: 0,2,4,6,8. Singleton at 6: truncate to [0..6] -> 0,2,4,6. Row 11: tile period 1: 0,1,...,8. Singleton at 7: truncate to [0..7] -> 0,1,...,7. Example 2 col 2: tile period 3, phase 2: 2,5,8. Singleton at row 2: truncate to [0..2] -> just 2. But output has 2,5,8. So this doesn't work for Example 2! Unless... in Example 2, the singleton is at position 2 which is the MINIMUM pattern position, and the pattern extends downward from there. Maybe truncation goes from singleton to last pattern position? Row 8 in Ex1: singleton at 6, last pattern at 2. Range would be [2, 6]? No, output has 0 included. I need to think about this differently. Let me reconsider what the 'pattern' cells are. Maybe in Example 2 col 2, the pattern cells are ALL three cells at rows 2,5,8 - the period is 3 and yellow is the singleton that happens to be at a pattern position. So the pattern naturally tiles at 2,5,8 (that's all that fits in 0..8 with period 3 phase 2). Replace green with yellow at ALL those positions. In Example 1 row 8: maroon at 0,2, magenta at 6. Pattern cells (maroon) at 0,2 -> period 2. Full tiling would give 0,2,4,6,8. But the singleton at 6 is on the pattern grid. Replace maroon with magenta. But why not position 8? Maybe because the tiling extends only as far as the furthest non-zero cell in the ORIGINAL input? Row 8 furthest non-zero is col 6 (the singleton). So tile from start up to col 6. That gives 0,2,4,6. Row 11 furthest non-zero is col 7 (singleton). Tile up to col 7: 0,1,2,...,7. Row 1 furthest non-zero is col 3. Tile from start: 0,3. But output has 0,3,6! So this doesn't work. UNLESS for no-singleton cases, tiling is full. For singleton aligned cases, tile up to max position of all cells. Let me check: Row 1 (no singleton): tile full -> 0,3,6. Row 4 (no singleton): tile full -> 0-8. Row 8 (singleton aligned): tile to max pos 6 -> 0,2,4,6. Row 11 (singleton aligned): tile to max pos 7 -> 0,...,7. Example 2 col 2 (singleton aligned): tile to max pos 8 -> 2,5,8 (all fit). Example 2 col 9 (no singleton): tile full -> 0-8. Example 2 col 15 (no singleton): tile full -> 0,4,8. Example 2 col 18 (singleton NOT aligned): tile full -> 0,2,4,6,8 + gray at 3. This works! Example 3 all no-singleton: tile full. Col 1 period 2 phase 0 -> 0,2,4,6. Col 5 period 1 -> 0-6. Col 9 period 1 -> 0-6. Col 13 period 3 phase 0 -> 0,3,6. All match! So the rule is: (a) no singleton or singleton not aligned: tile pattern color across full line (and keep singleton if present), (b) singleton aligned: replace pattern color with singleton color, tile from 0 up to max position of any non-zero cell in that line.\"\n",

            "Revision needed: Example 2 has one yellow that doesn't match: yellow at (15,11) ends up at (16,12) which is a wall cell (5) in the input. The output also adds a 5 at (16,14). I need to investigate this further.\\n\\nLet me reconsider: What if the sliding mechanism is that each yellow slides until it's adjacent to a wall of its enclosing shape in the encoded direction, but 'adjacent' means the yellow ends up in the last empty cell before hitting a wall OR at the wall itself if that position is on the boundary?\\n\\nActually, let me reconsider the geometry. What if (16,12) and (16,13) in the input are not part of the main boundary but rather a separate small cluster? The main boundary goes around the outside of the region. Looking at the connectivity:\\n\\nThe 5-cells at (16,12) and (16,13) connect to (17,12) and (17,13) which connect to (18,12) which connects to (18,11), (18,10), (18,9), (18,8) which connects up to (17,8), (16,8). And (16,8) connects to... (15,8)=5? Row 15 col 8 = 5. Yes! So (16,12-13) are connected to the main boundary through the bottom.\\n\\nBut also, (16,12) connects up to (15,14)=5 via (16,13)? (15,13)=0, (15,14)=5. (16,13) connects to (15,13)=0, not to (15,14)=5. So (16,12-13) connect to the boundary through the bottom but not the right side.\\n\\nWait, let me check: (15,14)=5 connects to what? In row 15: [0,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,4,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0]. (15,14)=5, (15,15)=5. And (14,14)=0, (14,15)=5. So (15,14-15) connect upward through (14,15), (13,15), (12,15), (11,15), (10,15), (9,15), (8,15)=5, (8,14)=5, (8,13)=5, (8,12)=5. So the right boundary goes from (8,12-15) down through (9-14,15) to (15,14-15).\\n\\nAnd the bottom boundary includes (16,12-13), (17,12-13), (18,8-12). \\n\\nBetween (15,14-15) on the right and (16,12-13) on the bottom, is there a connection? (16,14)=0 in the input. So there's a GAP at (16,14) between the right boundary and the bottom boundary! The boundary is NOT closed at that point!\\n\\nSo (15,14)-(15,15) is the right boundary, and (16,12)-(16,13) starts the bottom boundary, but there's a gap at (16,14). This means the enclosed region is NOT fully closed, and the yellow could potentially 'escape' through this gap.\\n\\nAH WAIT. If the boundary has a gap, then (16,12) is not actually a wall of the enclosed region in the direction the yellow is traveling - it's more like a peninsular cell. The actual wall that closes the region in the down-right direction would be further along.\\n\\nBut actually, even with a gap at (16,14), the cell (16,12) IS still a 5 cell. The yellow sliding down-right from (15,11) hits (16,12)=5 and should stop...\\n\\nUNLESS the rule is: the yellow slides until it reaches the boundary of the enclosed region. If there's a gap in the boundary, the yellow passes through the gap? But (16,12)=5 is not a gap, it's a wall.\\n\\nOK, new idea: What if the closing of the gap IS the transformation? The boundary at (16,14) gets a new 5 to close the gap, and the 5 at (16,12) is removed (replaced by yellow 4) because the yellow slides past it?\\n\\nThat's a very specific rule: the yellow slides in the direction, and if a wall cell is in the way but the boundary isn't closed there, the yellow takes the wall's position and the wall is regenerated to close the gap.\\n\\nThis is getting very complex. Let me try a simpler alternative: maybe the yellow just slides until hitting a wall and stops right there, replacing the wall cell. And any boundary repair is a separate step.\\n\\nLet me recheck Example 1 with this rule:\\nYellow at (6,9) slides right: (6,10)=0, (6,11)=0, (6,12)=7. Replace (6,12) with 4. But output (6,12)=7 and (6,11)=4. So it does NOT replace the wall in Example 1.\\n\\nSo the rule is inconsistent between examples... unless there's something special about Example 2.\\n\\nI think the most likely explanation is that my rule is correct (stop before wall) and the Example 2 anomaly is either an error or has a special case I can't figure out. I'll proceed with my hypothesis (stop before wall) which works for 7/8 cases across all three examples and see what happens.\\n\\nActually, wait! Let me reconsider one more time. What if the yellow at (15,11) actually slides to a position that I haven't considered? What if it doesn't go diagonally but in some modified direction?\\n\\nOr what if it slides diagonally but the check for 'wall' also considers other yellow markers that have already moved? What if the two yellows are processed in a specific order?\\n\\nIf yellow 1 at (9,3) moves first to (11,5), then yellow 2 at (15,11): from (15,11), slide down-right. (16,12)=5 wall. Can't move. Stays at (15,11). This doesn't change anything.\\n\\nIf yellow 2 moves first to... it can't move. Then yellow 1 moves to (11,5). Same result.\\n\\nOK let me just proceed with my hypothesis and note this as a potential issue. The core algorithm works for the vast majority of cases.\n",

For each active perpendicular line: same-colored cells (2+) define a repeating period; an optional singleton (different color) may exist. Without a singleton, the pattern tiles the entire line. With an aligned singleton (position mod period == phase), the pattern color is replaced by the singleton color and tiling is bounded to the range of all non-zero cells. With a non-aligned singleton, the pattern tiles the entire line and the singleton is preserved at its position.\n",

            "  • If there are more solids than hollows (or vice versa), unpaired positions get a 4x4 block of 0s\n",

(4) Extrapolate the boundary edge lines at their existing slopes through the opening to the grid edge, creating a wedge-shaped spill region. (5) Fill the spill region with the fill color, except where barrier pixels block their columns in the spill direction (from barrier position to grid edge).\n",

Need to figure out the polygon vertex ordering. Let me reconsider Hypothesis 1 with a specific ordering algorithm.\\n\\nLooking at the examples more carefully:\\n\\nExample 1 Green: (7,5),(7,6),(10,2),(10,9),(13,5),(13,6) forms diamond. The connections are: (7,5)-(7,6) horizontal, (7,5)-(10,2) diagonal, (7,6)-(10,9) diagonal, (10,2)-(13,5) diagonal, (10,9)-(13,6) diagonal, (13,5)-(13,6) horizontal. This is a closed polygon with vertices in order around the perimeter.\\n\\nExample 3 Orange: (4,4),(4,10),(5,11),(10,6),(10,4). Connections: (4,4)-(4,10) horizontal, (4,10)-(5,11) diagonal, (5,11)-(10,6) diagonal, (10,6)-(10,4) horizontal, (10,4)-(4,4) vertical. This is also a closed polygon!\\n\\nSo the rule seems to be: order vertices to form a closed polygon (traveling around the perimeter) and draw lines between consecutive vertices. The ordering could be by angle from centroid.\\n\\nLet me verify: Green centroid = (10, 5.5) approximately. Angles from centroid for each vertex... Actually for the convex hull approach, ordering vertices by angle from centroid would give the correct polygon.\\n\\nFor orange: centroid roughly at (6.7, 7). Vertices ordered by angle: (4,4) upper-left, (4,10) upper-right, (5,11) right, (10,6) lower-right, (10,4) lower-left. This gives the correct connections.\\n\\nKey: CONSECUTIVE vertices in this angular ordering must be axis-aligned (H/V/diagonal) for a line to be drawn. And the polygon is closed.\\n\\nActually wait - do ALL consecutive pairs need to be axis-aligned? Let me check. In green: all consecutive pairs in angular ordering are diagonal or horizontal - yes they're all aligned. In orange: all consecutive pairs are aligned. Good.\\n\\nRevised hypothesis: For multi-pixel groups, order vertices by angle from centroid to form a closed polygon, then draw lines between consecutive vertices. For single-pixel groups, find adjacent multi-pixel vertex, compute offset, and draw the entire multi-pixel shape shifted by that offset.\n",

            "Revision needed: Example 1 fails. All 6 diamonds appear to be in one 8-connected component of non-background cells, yet only 4 are filled. I need to reconsider. Let me look at what distinguishes the filled vs unfilled diamonds in example 1. Filled: green diamond C, gray diamond D, large red diamonds E and F. Unfilled: small red diamonds A and B. The unfilled ones are at the 'far end' of the blue path from the fill pixel. The fill pixel is at (17,23) bottom-right, and the path goes UP through col 22, LEFT through gray diamond D, then through diamond E, F, C, and eventually to A and B. Diamonds A and B are the farthest from the fill pixel along the path. But distance alone doesn't seem like a clean rule. Let me reconsider: maybe the connectivity isn't through ALL non-background cells. Maybe it's only through the path color (blue=1) and the fill pixel, not through diamond borders. In that case, diamond A connects to blue at (4,3), diamond B connects to blue at (5,8)/(5,11)/(4,6). But then diamond D connects to blue at (3,19)/(3,22), E connects to blue at (4,18), C connects to blue at (13,6)/(13,9), F connects to blue at (11,15). If we only follow blue(1) cells for connectivity, are all diamonds connected? The blue network seems to be one component. But then ALL diamonds would be connected, which still doesn't explain why A and B aren't filled. Hmm. Let me look at this differently. Maybe the rule involves the direction of the path from the fill pixel. The fill pixel is at (17,23). The path goes: col 22 up to row 3, then LEFT through gray diamond D, through cells connecting to diamond E. From E, path goes down through (8,16)-(9,16)-(10,16)-(11,15) to diamond F. From F via (13,11)-(13,6) to green diamond C. From C via (13,3) down through path to (8,5)-(7,6)...(7,10)-(6,11)-(5,11)-(5,8)...(5,4)-(4,3) to diamonds A and B. So the path from fill pixel hits D first, then E, then F, then C, then A, then B. Diamonds D,E,F,C are filled; A,B are not. Is there a branch point? Looking at the blue path: from (5,11), one direction goes UP to (6,11) and eventually toward the fill pixel. The other direction goes through (5,8)-(5,4)-(4,3) to diamonds A and B. So there's a junction at (5,11) or nearby. One branch leads to fill pixel (through F, E, D); the other branch leads to A and B (dead end). But C is also on the branch toward A/B: (13,6)-(13,3) connects to the path that eventually reaches A/B. Hmm. Actually wait - let me reconsider the exact path. From fill pixel at (17,23): go up col 22. At row 5, (5,22)=1. Then at (4,22)=1->(3,22)=1->(3,21)=5->(3,20)=5->(3,19)=1: this goes to gray diamond D. Then (4,18)=1->(4,17)=2 (diamond E). Diamond E->(8,16)=1->(9,16)=1->(10,16)=1->(11,15)=1->(11,14)=2,(11,13)=2 (diamond F top). Diamond F->(13,12)=2...(13,11)=1->green diamond C connectors. From green diamond C: (13,6)=1. But does (13,6) connect ONLY to the path going LEFT toward A/B, or also back toward the fill pixel? Actually (13,9)=1->(13,10)=1->(13,11)=1->(13,12)=2 (diamond F). And (13,6)=1->(13,3)=1->(14,3)=1. So (13,3) goes toward A/B. Now from the (5,11)=1 junction: going UP toward (6,11)=1->(7,10)=1 etc. goes AWAY from the fill pixel toward diamonds A/B. Going DOWN... (5,11) doesn't go directly down. But (5,11)->(6,11) is one step, and then from (6,11) diagonal to (7,10) going LEFT. This path seems to go LEFT and DOWN toward the (14,3) area, NOT toward the fill pixel. So how does the LEFT side connect to the fill pixel? Through the diamond E and diamond F borders! (6,15)=2 is diamond E border. (5,16)=2 is diamond E border. These connect to (4,17)=2 and (4,18)=1 which connects to gray diamond D and then col 22 line. But to get from (5,11) to (6,15), is there a path? (5,11)=1, (5,12)=0. (6,11)=1, (6,12)=0,...,(6,15)=2. Not directly connected. Hmm. Actually wait - I think I need to recheck whether the entire graph is actually one component or not. Let me see: is there truly a path from (5,11) to (6,15) through non-background cells? (5,11) connects to (6,11) (adjacent below). From (6,11)=1, check all 8 neighbors: (5,10)=2, (5,11)=1, (5,12)=0, (6,10)=0, (6,12)=0, (7,10)=1, (7,11)=0, (7,12)=0. So from (6,11), we can reach (5,10), (5,11), (7,10). (5,10)=2 is diamond B border. (7,10)=1 is blue path. From (7,10): neighbors include (7,9)=1,(7,11)=0,(6,10)=0,(6,11)=1,(8,10)=0,(8,11)=0,(8,9)=0,(6,9)=0. Row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,...]. So (7,6)-(7,10) are all 1. (7,6) connects to (8,5)=1. (8,5): row 8 [0,0,0,0,0,1,...]. Neighbors of (8,5): (7,4)=0,(7,5)=0,(7,6)=1,(8,4)=0,(8,6)=0,(9,4)=1,(9,5)=0,(9,6)=0. So from (8,5) we reach (7,6) and (9,4). (9,4)=1: row 9 [0,0,0,1,1,0,...]. (9,3)=1 too. (9,3) neighbors: (8,2)=0,(8,3)=0,(8,4)=0,(9,2)=0,(9,4)=1,(10,2)=0,(10,3)=0,(10,4)=0. Dead end leftward. But (13,3)=1 needs to connect somehow. Let me check cells between (9,3-4) and (13,3). (10,3)=0,(10,4)=0. (10,7)=3,(10,8)=3 (green diamond C). Are these connected to (9,4)? (10,7) and (9,4): too far. Hmm. Actually the path description says (9,3)-(9,4) connect upward through (8,5) but what about downward? From (9,3), go down: (10,2)=0,(10,3)=0,(10,4)=0. Dead end! And from (13,3): (12,3)=0,(12,4)=0,(14,3)=1,(14,4)=1,(14,5)=1. (14,5) neighbors: (13,4)=0,(13,5)=0,(13,6)=1,(15,4)=0,(15,5)=0,(15,6)=0. So (14,5) connects to (13,6)=1 diagonally. (13,6) is green diamond C's corner. So the path is: (14,5)->(13,6) connects to green diamond C, and (13,3)->(14,3)->(14,4)->(14,5)->(13,6). But does (13,3) connect to anything above? (12,2)=0,(12,3)=0,(12,4)=0. Dead end upward from (13,3). So (13,3)=1 connects DOWN to (14,3) but NOT up. And (9,3)=1 connects DOWN to... nothing? (10,2)=0,(10,3)=0,(10,4)=0. So (9,3-4) is a dead end going down. This means the path from diamonds A/B goes: (4,3)->(5,4)-(5,8)-(5,9)-(5,10) [diamond B border]. (5,10) 8-adj to (6,11)? (5,10) and (6,11): row diff=1, col diff=1. Yes! (6,11)->(7,10)->(7,6)->(8,5)->(9,4)->(9,3). DEAD END. And then a SEPARATE piece: (13,3)->(14,3)-(14,5)->(13,6) [green diamond C]. Then (13,9)->(13,10)-(13,11)->diamond F. Diamond F->(11,15)->path to diamond E->diamond D->col 22->fill pixel. So the question is: are the paths (9,3-4) and (13,3) connected? They're in the same column but rows 10-12 at col 3 are all 0. And there's no diagonal connection either. So the LEFT-SIDE PATH (diamonds A, B, and the segment (5,4)-(9,4)) is DISCONNECTED from the RIGHT-SIDE PATH (fill pixel, col 22, D, E, F, C, and segment (13,3)-(14,5)). Let me verify this. Is there any non-background cell connecting these two groups? The green diamond C at (10,7)-(10,8)-(11,6)-(11,9)-(12,6)-(12,9)-(13,7)-(13,8). Its corner cells (13,6)=1 and (13,9)=1 connect to the right-side path. Do any green diamond C border cells connect to the left-side path? (11,6)=3. Neighbors: (10,5)=0,(10,6)=0,(10,7)=3,(11,5)=0,(11,7)=0,(12,5)=0,(12,6)=3,(12,7)=0. So (11,6) only connects to other green diamond cells. (10,7)=3: (9,6)=0,(9,7)=0,(9,8)=0. Dead end upward. So green diamond C connects only rightward through (13,6) and (13,9) to the path to diamond F and ultimately to the fill pixel. And the left-side path (diamonds A, B) terminates at (9,3-4) with no connection to anything below row 9. So diamonds A and B are in a DIFFERENT connected component from the fill pixel! My original hypothesis WAS correct - I just made an error in tracing connectivity earlier. Let me re-verify: is there truly no non-background cell connecting the (9,3-4) dead end to the (13,3) path or to the green diamond C? Rows 10-12, cols 0-6: Row 10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,...]. Col 0-6 all 0. Row 11: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,...]. Col 0-5 all 0. (11,6)=3. Row 12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,...]. Col 0-5 all 0. (12,6)=3. So the gap between (9,3-4) and (11-12,6) is indeed all 0s. No connection. My hypothesis IS correct for example 1!\", \"predicted_output_description\": \"\", \"matches_expected\": false, \"discrepancies\": \"\"}]\n",

The key insight is that diagonal chains indicate gaps in straight lines that need to be filled. Let me think more carefully about the mechanics though.\\n\\nLooking more carefully at the examples:\\n\\nExample 1:\\n- Diagonal (3,19)\\u2192(4,20)\\u2192(5,21): This connects the end of the horizontal line at row 7 (which has a gap at cols 15-17 between the segment ending at col 14 and the segment starting at col 18) to... actually, it connects toward col 18/row 3 area. But the gap filled is on row 7 (cols 15-17). Also col 14 gap (rows 10-12) is filled.\\n- Diagonal (8,17)\\u2192(9,16): Near the gap on row 7 (cols 15-17). \\n- Diagonal (10,13)\\u2192(11,12): Near the gap on col 14 (rows 10-12).\\n\\nSo actually there seem to be multiple diagonal chains associated with one gap. Let me reconsider.\\n\\nActually, I think the rule is simpler: remove diagonal pixels, and for each straight line segment, extend it to continue until it reaches the next collinear segment. The diagonal pixels are just artifacts/noise that need to be removed, and the gaps that happen to exist between collinear segments get filled.\\n\\nBut wait - not all gaps get filled. In Example 1, the gap between col 4 vertical (rows 3-6) and the isolated pixel at (0,4) is NOT filled. The gap in row 7 between cols 2 and 6 is NOT filled. So it's not just 'fill all gaps'.\\n\\nThe key must be: only fill gaps that are associated with diagonal chains. The diagonal chains indicate WHERE gaps need to be filled.\"\n",

Find the unique 3x3 anchor position in the 7x7 meta-grid such that the input special tiles are a subset of P's positions at that anchor. Then stamp the complete pattern P at that anchor, making all corresponding tiles special.\n",

Let me check: for 2-bordered rects in Example 1, the chain D(rows7-11), E(rows9-13), F(rows13-17), G(rows16-20). In output: D at cols 12-16, E at cols 17-21, F at cols 12-16, G at cols 17-21. So the first in a 2-border chain goes to inner (cols 12-16), second to outer (cols 17-21), alternating. Wait - let me re-examine. Actually looking at the output more carefully for the 2-border chain: D at rows 7-11 is at cols 12-16 (inner), E at rows 9-13 is at cols 17-21 (outer), F at rows 13-17 has cols 12-16 (inner), G at rows 16-20 has cols 17-21 (outer). So for 2-border chains, first goes INNER then OUTER. But for standalone 2-border B, it goes to cols 17-21 (outer). Let me re-examine if standalone goes outer and chain-first also goes to a specific position. Actually, I need to reconsider: maybe for both border types, the first in a chain and standalone rects go to the OUTER position. Let me check 8-border in Ex1: chain A(rows1-5)->cols0-4 (outer), C(rows3-7)->cols5-9 (inner). So first goes outer. For 2-border chain: D(rows7-11)->cols12-16... that's inner! Hmm. Wait, maybe I should reconsider which is 'outer' for 2-border. If we think of the right side, cols 17-21 is the rightmost (outer edge of grid), and cols 12-16 is inner. So for 2-border, first in chain goes to cols 12-16 (closer to center) and alternates outward. But standalone B goes to cols 17-21 (outer). This is inconsistent.

            "Chosen: Hypothesis #2\n",
            "Reasoning: Hypothesis 2 (connected component based) is the most implementable and robust. The key insight is: find all connected components of 0s and 1s. The largest connected component of each color is 'structural'. All smaller components are 'defects'. 0-defects get orange(7) 8-neighbor rings, 1-defects get erased. The connectivity type needs careful consideration - I'll need to verify whether 4-connected or 8-connected works. Let me think about this: In Example 1, the black band at rows 5-8 is one large 0-region, and the black band at rows 14-16 is another. The defect at (4,8) is a single 0-pixel that is NOT connected to the large 0-band (it's in row 4, adjacent to row 5's band but row 4 col 8 connects to row 5 col 8 which is in the black band). Wait - if using 4-connectivity, (4,8) connects to (5,8) which is in the black band. So (4,8) would be part of the large 0-component! But it's treated as a defect. So maybe the defects are determined differently. Let me reconsider... Actually, looking more carefully at Ex2, the frame structure at rows 3-10, cols 2-12 has gaps at (5,2) and (8,4) which are blue pixels. These blue gaps connect the exterior blue region to the interior blue region, making them one connected component. But the frame itself (black pixels) is one connected component. The defect at (7,8) is inside the blue interior - it's a single 0-pixel. If using 4-connectivity, is (7,8) connected to the frame? No, the frame's interior boundary doesn't touch (7,8) directly in 4-connectivity. So (7,8) would be a separate small 0-component. This suggests the approach works with careful connectivity analysis. Let me re-examine Example 1 with 4-connectivity for the 0-pixels: (4,8) is adjacent to (5,8), which is in the black band. So with 4-connectivity, (4,8) merges with the large black band. That means it wouldn't be identified as a defect, but it IS treated as a defect. So 4-connectivity for 0s doesn't work directly. Hmm. Maybe I need to think differently about what's structural vs defect. Perhaps the structural regions are identified first (the clean geometric shapes), and then defects are pixels that deviate. Or perhaps I should use a different approach: the 'expected' color at each pixel is determined by the large-scale structure, and any pixel that deviates from expectation is a defect. Actually, let me reconsider - maybe ALL small components of both colors are defects, regardless of whether they connect to large components. The issue is that (4,8) in Ex1 would 4-connect to the large black band. So maybe I need to think about this differently. Perhaps the approach is: 1) identify the 'clean' grid by some method, 2) any pixel differing from the clean grid is a defect. Or perhaps: use morphological operations to identify noise pixels. Or: consider that defects are pixels where most of their 8-neighbors have the opposite color.\"\n",

            "Reasoning: Hypothesis 1 is the most precise and complete. The key challenge is defining what constitutes a 'defect' vs a 'region'. Let me think about connectivity: In example 3, the protrusion at (3,6) connects to the main blue rectangle if we use 4-connectivity (it's directly above (4,6) which is in the rectangle). So the protrusion would be part of the main blue component and NOT a defect. But it gets erased in the output... Wait, let me reconsider. Actually in example 3 output, (3,6) is changed to 0. So the protrusion IS treated as a defect. But it's 4-connected to the main blue rectangle. This means either: (a) defects aren't identified by connected components alone, or (b) there's something else going on. Let me reconsider - maybe the approach is about the geometric structure (clean rectangles/bands) rather than pure connected components. Or perhaps the definition involves looking at whether a pixel is 'anomalous' - like a single pixel sticking out from an otherwise clean boundary. Actually, let me reconsider. In example 3, the blue rectangle spans rows 4-12, cols 4-13. The pixel at (3,6) is one row above the top edge. In the output, it's erased. Similarly, isolated blue pixels at (4,15) and (14,1) in the black background are erased. The three holes inside the rectangle get orange borders. So the protrusion at (3,6) is being treated as a 1-defect in the 0-region (the black background above the rectangle). This makes sense if we think of it as: the protrusion pixel (3,6) is surrounded mostly by black pixels, so it belongs to the black region conceptually, even though it's connected to the blue rectangle. Actually I think a simpler interpretation works: identify the 'clean' geometric structure, and any pixels that deviate from it are defects. But that's hard to formalize. Let me try another approach: maybe use a size-based threshold on connected components, but with specific connectivity. If we use 8-connectivity for 0-components and 4-connectivity for 1-components... No, that's too ad hoc. Actually, let me reconsider example 3 more carefully. The pixel at (3,6) is 1, and it's connected to the main blue region. But the main blue region in the output loses this pixel. So it's not simply about connected components. Maybe the rule is: for each pixel, look at its 8-neighborhood. If a pixel's color is different from the majority of its neighbors (or some measure of local context), it's a defect. But that wouldn't work for the L-shape in example 1. Let me think about this differently. Perhaps the rule works iteratively or uses morphological operations. Or perhaps the key is that the 'clean' structure is determined by large-scale features (bands, rectangles, frames) and any small perturbation is a defect. Maybe: the grid consists of large rectangular regions, and any pixel that doesn't fit neatly into the rectangular tiling is a defect. Actually, I think the simplest approach might be: use connected components, but apply a size threshold. Small components of 0 in a 1 context get borders. Small components of 1 in a 0 context get erased. For the protrusion in example 3: if we use 8-connectivity, the protrusion at (3,6) connects to the main blue component. But with 4-connectivity it also connects via (4,6). Hmm. So the protrusion must be considered part of the main blue component regardless of connectivity. This means the defect identification can't be purely about isolated small components... Unless we pre-process to separate 'clean' regions from 'noise'. I'll proceed with hypothesis 1 for now but need to figure out the exact mechanism during verification.\"\n",

For 2-border, chains start at cols 12-16 (inner position), standalones go to cols 17-21 (right edge). Let me re-examine why there's this asymmetry...\\n\\nActually, maybe the simpler way to think about it: for both types, chains start at the 'first' column position. For 8-border: pos1=cols 0-4, pos2=cols 5-9. For 2-border: pos1=cols 12-16, pos2=cols 17-21. Chains always start at pos1. Standalones: 8-border go to pos1 (=cols 0-4), 2-border go to pos2 (=cols 17-21). Why would standalones differ? Maybe standalone 2-border rects go to the edge (rightmost), while chains build from inner to outer?\\n\\nAlternatively: Standalones ALWAYS go to the grid edge. 8-border edge = cols 0-4. 2-border edge = cols 17-21. Chains also start at the edge for 8-border (which happens to be pos1), but for 2-border chains start at inner (pos1=cols 12-16) not the edge.\\n\\nHmm, let me try yet another perspective. What if standalone = edge position, and chain starting position depends on the chain being even or odd length? No, that doesn't make sense.\\n\\nLet me just accept the pattern as observed: 8-border always uses cols 0-4 as starting position (for both chains and standalones), alternating with cols 5-9. 2-border chains start at cols 12-16 alternating with cols 17-21, and standalones go to cols 17-21.\\n\\nActually wait - what if for 2-border standalones, they are just treated as a chain of length 1 that starts at cols 17-21? And for 2-border, the alternation goes: 17-21, 12-16, 17-21, 12-16...? Let me check:\\n\\nEx1 2-border chain of 4: [rows7, rows9, rows13, rows16]\\nOutput positions: 12-16, 17-21, 12-16, 17-21\\nIf starting at 17-21: 17-21, 12-16, 17-21, 12-16 - NO that doesn't match.\\nIf starting at 12-16: 12-16, 17-21, 12-16, 17-21 - YES matches.\\n\\nSo 2-border chains start at 12-16. But standalone goes to 17-21. This is position 2 for standalone, position 1 for chain start.\\n\\nHmm. What if the rule is: standalone rects go to the side closest to the edge of the grid? I.e., standalone 8-border rects go to cols 0-4 (left edge), standalone 2-border go to cols 17-21 (right edge). Chain rects alternate starting from pos1=0-4 for 8-border and pos1=12-16 for 2-border.\\n\\nThat's consistent and I'll go with this revised hypothesis.\"}\n",

            "  • When the corridor has a bottleneck too narrow for the block, 0 stops at the last valid position before the bottleneck\n",

If there's a bottleneck too narrow for the block, 0 stops at the farthest valid position it can reach. The 2-block always remains in its original position.

A \"diagonal pixel\" is a foreground pixel with no orthogonal foreground neighbor but at least one diagonal foreground neighbor. These diagonal pixels are grouped into chains. For each chain that is diagonally adjacent to a \"straight\" pixel (one with an orthogonal foreground neighbor) at the endpoint of a line segment, the line segment is extended in its gap direction to connect to the next collinear segment. Floating diagonal chains (not adjacent to any straight pixel) are simply removed.\n",

            "Reasoning: Let me re-examine more carefully. The quadrant hypothesis seems most promising but I need to handle the edge cases. Let me re-check orange in Ex2: Orange at (12,13) and (13,12),(13,13). Center of mass: rows = (12+13+13)/3 = 12.67, cols = (13+12+13)/3 = 12.67. Grid center = (15, 15). Row offset = 12.67-15 = -2.33 (above center). Col offset = 12.67-15 = -2.33 (left of center). Product = +5.43 (positive = upper-left quadrant). According to hypothesis, should go to bottom. But it goes to TOP. Wait - maybe I need to re-examine the hypothesis directions. Let me re-derive from examples. Ex1: Yellow (upper-left, product positive) -> bottom. Red (upper-left, product positive) -> bottom. Blue center ~(12, 13). Offset: (12-14, 13-9.5) = (-2, 3.5). Product = -7 (negative = upper-right) -> top. Green center ~(19, 3). Offset: (19-14, 3-9.5) = (5, -6.5). Product = -32.5 (negative = lower-left) -> top. So negative product -> top, positive product -> bottom in Ex1. Ex2: Blue center ~(5.5, 5). Offset: (-9.5, -10). Product = +95 -> bottom ✓. Green center ~(4.5, 23). Offset: (-10.5, 8). Product = -84 -> top ✓. Red center ~(18, 5.5). Offset: (3, -9.5). Product = -28.5 -> top ✓. Yellow center ~(18, 21). Offset: (3, 6). Product = +18 -> bottom ✓. Orange center ~(12.67, 12.67). Offset: (-2.33, -2.33). Product = +5.43 -> should go BOTTOM but goes TOP. Maroon center ~(12.33, 16.67). Offset: (-2.67, 1.67). Product = -4.45 -> top ✓. So the issue is ONLY with orange. Let me re-check: In the output of Ex2, orange is at rows 0-1. Yes, it goes to top. But by the quadrant rule it should go to bottom. Unless I'm wrong about the orange object's location. Let me re-examine: Input has orange(7) at (12,13),(13,12),(13,13). That's 3 cells. Center = ((12+13+13)/3, (13+12+13)/3) = (12.67, 12.67). Both below 15, so upper-left quadrant, product positive. Hmm. Maybe I should reconsider whether the rule uses min_row or center. If using min_row=12 and min_col=12: both < 15, so upper-left. Still the same. Wait, what if I use a different grid center? What if the center is computed from the objects themselves, not the grid? Or what if there's a different criterion altogether? Let me think about this differently - maybe the rule is based on the direction the shape 'points' or some other geometric property. Or maybe it's simpler: in Ex2, orange is close to center and gets grouped with nearby maroon, and both go to top? Actually, let me re-examine if there's a pairing logic. In both examples, objects seem to go in groups. Maybe the rule is that objects in the upper half go to bottom and objects in lower half go to top (vertical flip/swap), but with the center line being the midpoint between objects, not the grid center? Or maybe the dividing line is not at the center of the grid? Actually wait - let me reconsider. What if the product rule is flipped: positive product -> top, negative product -> bottom? Ex1: Yellow positive -> bottom (wrong). No, that doesn't work either. Let me try yet another approach. What about using the anti-diagonal? The perceiver's hypothesis #2 mentioned main diagonal vs anti-diagonal distance. Let me think about this more carefully... Actually, I wonder if there's a simpler rule I'm missing. Let me just list all objects and their destinations again very carefully.\n",

            "  • The grid has a 'template area' (upper portion filled with background color) containing small shapes/patterns, and multiple horizontal 'bands' (colored stripes spanning full width, separated by background-color rows)\n",
            "  • Each band has: edge color (corners/left-right borders), fill color (interior), and spans several rows\n",
            "  • Templates in the upper area are small rectangular patterns made of 2 colors against the background\n",
            "  • In the output, ALL template shapes are removed from the upper area (replaced with background)\n",
            "  • Each template gets 'stamped' into bands whose fill color matches one of the template's colors\n",
            "  • When stamping: template pixels matching the band's fill color are recolored to the band's edge color; other template pixels remain as band fill (invisible)\n",
            "  • Templates appear to be bottom-aligned within each band, with the template's last row placed at the band's last content row\n",
            "  • Column positions of templates are preserved from their original positions in the template area\n",

All blue cells become red. The detour goes away from the blue-clustered end (which is always at a grid wall).\n",

Each band has a fill color and corner color. The transformation: (1) clears the canvas to background, (2) stamps each shape into every band whose fill color matches one of the shape's colors. When a shape's color matches the band fill, those pixels become the band's corner color. Pixels of other colors in the shape are NOT drawn (they stay as band fill, effectively invisible). Shapes maintain their column positions and are bottom-aligned within bands. The key insight: only pixels whose original color matches the band's fill color get recolored to the corner color.

It provides a clean rule: project min(count, available_space) pixels outward from the tip. However, I notice that hypothesis 3 also works for all examples. Let me verify hypothesis 2 more carefully, and if needed I can check hypothesis 3. The key difference: in Example 3, hypothesis 2 says min(7,3)=3 and hypothesis 3 says distinct_rows=3. Both give 3. I need to find if there's a case where they differ. Actually looking more carefully, let me re-examine. For Example 1, the projection is horizontal. Hypothesis 2: yellow container tip at (3,6) pointing right, 2 magenta inside, distance to right edge = 12-6-1=5, min(2,5)=2. Hypothesis 3: distinct columns of magenta = {2,3} = 2 columns... wait that doesn't seem right for horizontal projection. Let me reconsider. Actually for hypothesis 3 with horizontal projection, we'd count distinct columns which is {3,2} = 2, matching. Both work. I'll go with hypothesis 2 as it's more intuitive and handles the edge case explicitly.\n",

            "Cross-example patterns: All examples convert horizontal full-width bands into concentric rectangular frames in a square output. The band sequence from top to bottom defines the frame sequence from outside to inside. Each frame's thickness matches the corresponding band's row count. The output dimension is 2 * (sum of all band heights except the last) + last band height, which equals 2 * sum_of_all - last_height. Actually it should just be 2 * total_rows - innermost_band_height... wait, let me recalculate. Ex0: total rows = 14, bands = [2,5,1,2,2,2] sum=14. Output = 26. So output = 2*14 - 2 = 26. Ex1: total rows = 13, bands = [1,1,2,1,1,1,4,2] sum=13. Output = 24 = 2*13 - 2. So output_size = 2 * total_input_rows - innermost_band_height. But wait, the innermost band has height 2 in both cases. Let me reconsider: output_size = 2 * sum_of_all_thicknesses = 2*14=28? No, it's 26. Actually output_size = 2*(sum - last) + last = 2*12 + 2 = 26. And 2*11 + 2 = 24. Yes! The formula is: output_size = 2 * (sum of all band heights except last) + last band height.\n",

Let me reconsider: In Ex1, the shapes are at various columns but all different rows - the anchor is at a unique row too. The anchor column (5) differs from embedded marker columns (2, 6, 2). So shapes need to shift horizontally. In Ex2, the anchor row (4) differs from embedded marker rows (3, 7, 6). So shapes need to shift vertically. In both cases, the anchor is at an edge of the grid. I'll use the edge-position heuristic from hypothesis 2 to determine axis, but implement hypothesis 1's general approach.\n",

The key insight is: the isolated marker defines the target position, and structures shift to align their embedded markers to that position. The axis of alignment needs to be determined - it appears to be the axis along which the isolated marker's position differs from the embedded markers' positions. Actually, looking more carefully: in Ex2, the green structures shift ONLY vertically (to match the row of the isolated blue at row 4), and the yellow+magenta composite shifts ONLY vertically. But some structures also shift horizontally in Ex2 - the 3x3 frame shifted both down 1 and left 1. Wait, let me recheck... Actually in Ex2 output, the 3x3 frame has blue center at (4,9) - the original was at (3,10). So it shifted down 1, left 1. Hmm, that doesn't match pure row alignment. Let me reconsider - maybe the alignment is to BOTH row AND column of the anchor? No, that can't be right because in Ex1 the structures don't all move to the same row. OK so let me think again about Ex2 more carefully. The isolated blue is at (4,0). The green frames align their blue centers to row 4 only (not column 0). The 3x3 frame blue center moves from (3,10) to (4,9)... wait, maybe I need to recheck the output grid more carefully.\"}\n",

The 4x4 frame has relative positions (0,0) to (3,3), center of 2x2 interior is at (1.5, 1.5). For each gap at relative position (r,c), direction = (r-1.5, c-1.5). Normalize by taking sign of each component: (-1,-1)=up-left diagonal, (-1,0)=up, (-1,1)=up-right diagonal, etc. This cleanly gives 8 directions for 12 border positions. Let me verify: (0,0)\\u2192(-1.5,-1.5)\\u2192(-1,-1)=NW, (0,1)\\u2192(-1.5,-0.5)\\u2192(-1,-1)=NW? No, sign(-0.5)=-1, so this also gives NW. That means (0,1) would be NW diagonal not straight up. Let me re-check example 4 where gap at (2,2) in frame relative is (0,1), and the ray goes straight up col 2. Hmm, that contradicts NW. So maybe hypothesis 3 is better - the side determines direction, corners are diagonal, non-corners are cardinal. Let me reconsider... Actually, let me recalculate. In example 4, frame rows 2-5, cols 1-4. The 2x2 interior is at rows 3-4, cols 2-3. The gap at (2,2) - relative to frame top-left (2,1) is (0,1). This is on the top row, non-corner position. Direction should be straight up. Let me check example 2: gap at (2,3) relative to frame TL (2,1) is (0,2) - top row, non-corner. Direction straight up col 3. Output confirms. Gap at (4,4) relative to frame TL is (2,3) - right column, non-corner. Direction straight right. Output confirms. Gap at (5,1) relative to frame TL is (3,0) - bottom-left corner. Direction diagonal down-left. Output confirms. So hypothesis 3 is actually correct! Let me switch to that.\"}\n",

            "Reasoning: Let me reconsider all examples more carefully to find the unified rule. I need to look at this differently.\\n\\nLet me re-examine each example focusing on what the azure structures encode:\\n\\nExample 1: Row 0 has [1,2,8,8,8]. The blue(1) pattern in rows 1-4 is at specific positions. Output replaces blue with red and fills rightward. The '8's in the header might indicate 'fill direction' or the header encodes 'replace 1 with 2, using 8 as template'.\\n\\nExample 4: Two 3-cell composites: [2,1,8] horizontal and [8,2,1] vertical. Both contain 2,1,8. The structural lines (blue horizontal, red vertical) swap to (red horizontal, blue vertical). So the composites encode: swap blue(1) and red(2). Azure(8) is just part of the encoding.\\n\\nExample 2: The diamond has a cross inside with colors 7,6 vertically and 4,2 horizontally. The borders are: top=6, bottom=7, left=2, right=4. Output swaps top/bottom (6<->7) and left/right (2<->4). Plus borders expand.\\n\\nExample 3: Near upper diamond: red(2) at (11,9), yellow(4) at (12,9). Near lower X: blue(1) at (13,14), orange(7) at (14,14). Yellow diamonds become red patterns. Blue diamond becomes orange pattern.\\n\\nI think hypothesis 1 is closest but I need to refine it during verification. The key insight is that azure shapes plus nearby color markers define color transformations, and the remaining colored elements get transformed accordingly.\n",

            "Revision needed: I need to refine my understanding of the rule. The core idea is:\\n\\n1. Find all objects (tiles) separated by background\\n2. Each tile has a 'frame' color and 'interior' color(s)\\n3. One tile has a unique 'marker' color (like yellow) that doesn't appear in other tiles - this marker is removed\\n4. Tiles are assembled into a larger rectangle where frame-colored edges face outward\\n5. The result is placed centered (or at a computed position) on a background grid\\n\\nFor Example 1, the assembly is more complex because the main template has multiple panels (horizontal divider). For Example 2, it's a simple 2x2 tiling.\\n\\nThe exact placement rule needs more investigation - it seems to be roughly centered in the grid.\\n\\nActually, I realize I need to think about this more carefully. In Example 1, the template has a FRAME structure (left bar, top, middle, bottom) and the interior is split into panels. Other objects don't have the same frame structure - they have partial frames or different structures. The key insight is that each non-template object's interior (the fill-color pattern) gets concatenated with the matching panel of the template.\\n\\nFor Example 2, there's no multi-panel template, so all pieces are simply tiled in 2D based on their edge orientations.\\n\\nI think both examples share the same fundamental rule: assemble tiles so that frame-colored edges face outward, producing a single bordered rectangle. For Example 1, the template's divider creates an internal structure, and additional pieces extend the width of each panel.\n",

The transformation identifies specific chains and recolors them: the connector pixels become gray(5), and one of the endpoint 2x2 blocks becomes green(3). The key question is: which chains get recolored and which endpoint becomes green? It appears that chains where both endpoints are the SAME color get recolored - the connector becomes 5 and both endpoints become 3. Chains where endpoints are DIFFERENT colors remain unchanged.

(2) The center 3x3 hole is filled by taking the innermost cell (closest to hole center) from each of the 8 surrounding blocks and placing it at the corresponding position in the center. (3) The center pixel of the hole is set to the most common non-background color in the pattern.\n",

L-shaped triominoes (3 cells in a 2x2 minus one corner) come in pairs of the same color with 180° rotated orientations. For each pair whose color is in the legend, the combined bounding box is filled with the mapped color, and the pair's own L-shape cells are restored on top. Fills are processed in reverse legend row order (bottom row first), so later-processed fills overwrite earlier ones in overlap regions. Non-L-shape objects whose color appears in the legend get recolored accordingly. The legend block itself is preserved.\n",

            "Revision needed: The hypothesis works perfectly for Examples 1 and 3, and mostly for Example 2 (3/4 structures shift correctly with row-only alignment). Only the 3x3 green frame in Example 2 has an unexplained -1 column shift. Let me reconsider whether there's a subtlety I'm missing about Example 2.\\n\\nNew idea: What if there are TWO anchor cells in each example that define both axes? In Ex1, the anchor yellow at (17,5) gives column=5 and row=17. Maybe structures align to column 5 only (row doesn't change because they're already spread out vertically). In Ex3, anchor red at (0,4) gives column=4.\\n\\nIn Ex2, there are TWO anchors: blue(1) at (4,0) and magenta(6) at (8,0). Blue at (4,0) gives row=4 AND column=0. Maybe the structures not only align rows to 4, but also shift columns TOWARD 0?\\n\\nFrame A: blue center (7,5) -> target (4,0). Row shifts -3 to reach row 4. Column: should shift toward 0 but doesn't. Hmm.\\n\\nAlternatively, what if the column alignment only applies when the row shift is small? Frame B shifts +1 row (small), so it also gets -1 column. Frame A shifts -3 rows, Frame C shifts -2 rows, so no column shift?\\n\\nOr: the column shift = sign of the column difference from anchor col? Anchor at col 0. Frame A at col 5: should shift left. But it doesn't. Frame B at col 10: should shift left, and it does by 1. Frame C at col 15: should shift left. But it doesn't.\\n\\nNone of these work consistently. Let me try yet another approach.\\n\\nWhat if the rule is simpler: each structure shifts so its marker moves to the NEAREST grid position that has the same row (or column) as the anchor, AND the structure doesn't overlap any other structure or go out of bounds?\\n\\nFor Ex2 with row alignment to row 4:\\n- Frame A shifts from (7,5) to (4,5). No overlap. ✓\\n- Frame C shifts from (6,15) to (4,15). No overlap. ✓\\n- Frame B shifts from (3,10) to (4,10). Would it overlap anything? Frame B at rows 3-5, cols 9-11. Frame A at rows 1-4, cols 4-6. No overlap. Cross at rows 3-5, cols 14-17. No overlap. So frame B at (4,10) wouldn't overlap. Still no reason for the -1 shift.\\n\\nLet me just assume my hypothesis is correct (align marker to anchor's row or column) and the -1 column shift in Ex2 is either: (a) a very subtle secondary rule I can't figure out, or (b) just the way it is and I need to accept some imprecision. Let me move forward, and when implementing, I'll stick with the simpler rule (align only one axis). If the test outputs don't match, I'll reconsider.\\n\\nWait, one more idea: what about diagonal shifts? What if the shift vector always maintains the same direction (toward the anchor)?\\n\\nFrame B marker at (3,10), anchor at (4,0). Direction vector: (1,-10). To shift row by +1, we'd also shift column by -10. But the actual column shift is -1, not -10.\\n\\nUnless the column shift is row_shift * (anchor_col - marker_col) / (anchor_row - marker_row)? That's (1 * (0-10)) / (4-3) = -10. Still too much.\\n\\nOr just sign: -1 * sign(1) = -1? Frame A: marker at (7,5). Direction to (4,0): (-3,-5). Row shift -3, col shift proportional: -3 * (-5) / (-3) = -5. Actual: 0. Nope.\\n\\nOK I truly cannot figure this out. Let me just proceed with my mostly-correct hypothesis.\"}\n",

So maybe it creates: top row has 3 columns, bottom-left has 2 sub-columns, bottom-right is undivided = that's messy. Actually, let me reconsider: the output for red in ex1 is 4 cells.

The key unresolved issues are: (1) why (13,14) in example 3 doesn't produce a ray, and (2) how interacting rays from different objects deflect. For issue (1), I'll need to look more carefully at the frame structure. For issue (2), I'll try modeling ray-ray interactions. Let me revise: maybe gaps are only those cells where the cell is orthogonally between two existing frame cells (i.e., has frame-colored neighbors on at least 2 sides that are not opposite), OR is adjacent to an interior cell. This would include (5,1) in Ex2 (adjacent to green on 2 non-opposite sides) and (10,13)/(11,11) in Ex3 yellow (adjacent to interior and green) but exclude (13,14) which... also has green on 2 non-opposite sides. Hmm. Let me try a completely different approach to gap identification: maybe a gap is a background cell that, if we trace from the center of the interior in the outward direction through this cell, it passes through the cell. I.e., the gap is 'visible' from the interior center. Center of yellow interior: (11.5, 12.5). For (13,14): direction from center = (1.5, 1.5). The line from center through (13,14) passes through... well, it would go through (12,13) then (13,14). (12,13) is interior. So it IS visible from center. For (5,1): center of Ex2 interior is (3.5, 2.5). Direction to (5,1): (1.5, -1.5). Line passes through (4,2) interior, then (5,1). Also visible. So both are visible. Not helpful. I'm going to try implementing the straightforward rule and see if the code produces correct output for examples 2 and 4, then debug from there.\"\n",

            "Revision needed: I still cannot explain the -1 column shift for Frame B in Example 2. However, my hypothesis correctly handles 11/12 structures across all 3 examples. Let me re-examine Example 2 one more time with fresh eyes.\\n\\nWait - I just had a new idea. What if the composite structures include more cells than I initially thought? Specifically, what if the yellow bar at column 2 is considered PART OF one of the green frame structures?\\n\\nNo, the yellow bar is a different color and is spatially separated from the green frames.\\n\\nAnother idea: What if the grouping uses 8-connectivity (including diagonals)? Let me check if any structures become connected with 8-connectivity that aren't with 4-connectivity.\\n\\nFrame A at rows 4-7, cols 4-6. Yellow bar at rows 2-5, col 2. The nearest cells: (4,4) from frame A and (4,2) from yellow bar. Distance is 2 cols. Not even 8-connected.\\n\\nFrame B at rows 2-4, cols 9-11. Frame A at rows 4-7, cols 4-6. Nearest cells: (4,6) and (4,9). Distance 3. Not connected.\\n\\nHmm, what about the isolated blue at (4,0) - could it be 8-connected to anything? Nearest non-background: yellow at (4,2). Distance 2. Not connected.\\n\\nOK, another thought: what if the rule involves the structures moving to align their marker to the nearest point on the anchor's row/column LINE, where 'nearest' means in Chebyshev distance or taxicab distance? For row alignment, the nearest point on row 4 from (3,10) is (4,10) in taxicab distance = 1, or (4,9) in Chebyshev distance (diagonally, (3,10)->(4,9) is distance 1). Hmm, Chebyshev distance! \\n\\nIf the rule uses Chebyshev distance (diagonal moves count as 1 step), then moving from (3,10) to (4,9) is 1 step diagonally, same as moving from (3,10) to (4,10) which is 1 step down. Both are distance 1 in Chebyshev. But why choose (4,9) over (4,10)?\\n\\nMaybe the shift is: move the marker toward the anchor cell (4,0) using the minimum number of Chebyshev steps needed to reach the anchor's row? The vector from (3,10) to (4,0) is (+1,-10). To move 1 step toward (4,0) in Chebyshev: we move (+1,-1), reaching (4,9). That's exactly the observed shift!\\n\\nLet me verify with other structures:\\n- Frame A: marker at (7,5), anchor at (4,0). Vector: (-3,-5). Move 3 Chebyshev steps toward anchor: each step (-1,-1), reaching (4,2). But actual output has marker at (4,5), not (4,2). FAIL.\\n\\nSo this doesn't work either. Frame A should shift to (4,2) but stays at (4,5).\\n\\nHmm, unless the Chebyshev movement is capped at the row_shift magnitude? Frame A needs 3 row steps. Chebyshev: move 3 steps, each (-1,-1), ending at (4,2). But actual is (4,5). Nope.\\n\\nWhat if the column shift per row step is sign(anchor_col - marker_col) * (1 if |row_shift| >= 1 else 0), but only applied once total, not per step? So col_shift = sign(0 - 10) = -1 for all frames whose row is being shifted.\\n\\nFrame A: row 7->4, col shift -1: marker at (4,4). Actual: (4,5). No.\\nFrame B: row 3->4, col shift -1: marker at (4,9). Actual: (4,9). YES!\\nFrame C: row 6->4, col shift -1: marker at (4,14). Actual: (4,15). No.\\n\\nOnly works for frame B.\\n\\nOK, what if only the SIGN of the row shift matters? Frame B is the only one that moves DOWN (positive delta_row). For downward-moving structures, the column also shifts by -1 (toward anchor col)? For upward-moving structures, no column shift?\\n\\nFrame A: -3 rows (up), 0 col. ✓\\nFrame B: +1 row (down), -1 col. ✓\\nFrame C: -2 rows (up), 0 col. ✓\\n\\nThis works! But it's a strange rule. Let me check if it applies to the other examples.\\n\\nEx1: anchor at (17,5). Column alignment.\\nStructure 1: yellow at (4,2) -> (4,5). Delta_col = +3 (rightward). Row shift = 0 (correct, no row shift).\\nStructure 2: yellow at (9,6) -> (9,5). Delta_col = -1 (leftward). Row shift = 0.\\nStructure 3: yellow at (14,2) -> (14,5). Delta_col = +3 (rightward). Row shift = 0.\\n\\nIf the rule is 'if shifting LEFT, also shift row down by 1', then:\\nStructure 2 shifts left (toward anchor col 5 from col 6), so it would also shift down 1 row. But in the output, row stays at 9. So this contradicts.\\n\\nSo the 'sign of shift determines secondary shift' rule doesn't work consistently across examples.\\n\\nI think at this point, I should just accept the discrepancy and proceed. My hypothesis correctly handles the vast majority of cases (11/12). The Ex2 frame B anomaly might be due to a more complex rule that I can't deduce from 3 examples. Let me proceed to implementation with the simpler rule (align marker to anchor row/column, preserving the other coordinate), and see how the test cases work out.\"}\n",

The one discrepancy (Ex2 Frame B) is a single column off by 1, which might be due to a secondary rule I can't identify or could be an anomaly. Hypothesis 1 fails worse (it incorrectly predicts Frame A's position). I'll proceed with hypothesis 2 as it's the most reliable and implementable.

            "Revision needed: I'm going to accept this hypothesis despite the single-cell discrepancy in Example 2. My hypothesis is correct for 11/12 structures. I believe the discrepancy might be due to a diagonal movement toward the anchor that only applies when the primary shift is small (1 step). But I cannot confirm this pattern with just one case.\\n\\nLet me try one final idea: what if the shift is computed not just along one axis but as: move N steps toward the anchor, where N = |primary_axis_shift|? Each step moves 1 unit on primary axis and sign(secondary_diff) on secondary axis (unless secondary diff is 0).\\n\\nFrame A: anchor (4,0), marker (7,5). N=3 (row shift). Steps: (-1,-1),(-1,-1),(-1,-1) -> from (7,5) to (4,2). Actual: (4,5). FAILS.\\n\\nUnless the secondary shift only applies when moving AWAY from the anchor's edge? The anchor is on col 0 (left edge). Frame A at col 5 would move further from the edge (shift right? no, toward col 0 is left). \\n\\nActually, frame A IS moving toward col 0 with the (-1,-1) steps. From col 5 to col 2. But the actual output keeps it at col 5. So this rule fails for frame A.\\n\\nWhat if the secondary shift is: sign(secondary_diff) * min(1, N) ? I.e., max 1 step in secondary direction regardless.\\n\\nFrame A: sign(0-5)*min(1,3) = -1. Marker at (4,4). Actual: (4,5). Still off.\\nFrame B: sign(0-10)*min(1,1) = -1. Marker at (4,9). Actual: (4,9). ✓\\nFrame C: sign(0-15)*min(1,2) = -1. Marker at (4,14). Actual: (4,15). Off.\\n\\nOnly works for B again. I give up trying to explain this.\\n\\nI'll proceed with the simple single-axis alignment hypothesis. It works for 2 examples perfectly and 3/4 structures in the third.\"}\n",

Fragments are only placed if their target corner is adjacent to at least one edge with a marker (for 2-marker cases).\n",

The interaction model has been verified to work correctly for all traced cases. For the test inputs, I'll compute outputs using this rule. The (13,14) issue may be a special case or may require a rule I haven't discovered, but it only affects 5 cells in one example out of 4. I can also check: maybe the frame detection should use a different approach - perhaps looking at the actual pattern of green cells around each interior and finding gaps where a 'line' of green is broken, rather than assuming a full 4x4 rectangle. Corner cells might not always be part of the expected frame.\"}\n",

For each interior even row, direction flags are computed by comparing leftmost/rightmost barrier centers in the odd row above vs below. LEFT flag (lower leftmost > upper leftmost) → 3,3 pair at left edge; RIGHT flag (lower rightmost < upper rightmost) → 3,3 pair at right edge. If the even row has 0-anomalies, pairs downgrade to singles and extra 3s appear adjacent to 0s. The top row gets no 3s. The bottom row gets single 3s at edges (or adjacent to 0-anomalies if present).\n",

            "Reasoning: The geometric fitting approach (hypothesis 3) is the most robust because the exact mapping rule between input positions and output quadrants isn't clear from just 2 examples (in Example 1, BL input -> BR output and BR input -> BL output, which breaks a simple positional mapping). A brute-force tiling approach that tries all assignments and rotations will find the correct solution without needing to guess the assignment rule. However, I need to think more carefully about how the shapes interlock. Let me reconsider the approach: rather than treating this as quadrant assignment, I should think of it as placing shapes corner-by-corner. The key shape goes to TL corner. Then each remaining shape is placed in one of the other 3 corners with some rotation, and together they tile the N×N grid.\n",

            "Reasoning: Hypothesis 2 is the only one that correctly handles all three examples. Let me verify: Example 1 (2x2→vertical, sorted by size ascending), Example 2 (vertical→horizontal, reversed order), Example 3 (horizontal→vertical, same order). However, the rules differ per layout type, which is suspicious. Let me think more carefully about a unifying principle. Actually, wait - maybe for Examples 2 and 3, it's not about reversing vs keeping order. Let me re-examine. In Example 2 (vertical stack → horizontal row), the bottom panel goes to the left. In Example 3 (horizontal row → vertical stack), the left panel goes to the top. Both of these are simply reading the panels in the same order and placing them in the new orientation - the 'reversal' in Example 2 is because when you transpose from vertical to horizontal, you naturally reverse: the last vertical panel becomes the first horizontal panel IF you think of it as a transpose/rotation. Actually no - in Example 3, left→top means the first horizontal panel becomes the first vertical panel. That's just direct mapping. In Example 2, top→right means the first vertical panel becomes the last horizontal panel - that IS a reversal. Hmm, unless... Let me reconsider. Maybe the transformation for linear layouts is simply a transpose of the entire grid. If the input is 17×5 and you transpose it to 5×17, then the horizontal separator rows become vertical separator columns, but the panel contents would also get transposed. Let me check if panel contents are transposed in Example 2. Input panel 1 (azure): rows 0-4 of 5-wide grid. Azure at (1,2),(1,3),(2,2),(2,3),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2). Output panel 3 (rightmost, azure): cols 12-16 of 5-tall grid. Azure at (1,14),(1,15),(2,14),(2,15),(3,12),(3,13),(3,14). Relative positions within panel: Input: (1,2),(1,3),(2,2),(2,3),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2). Output: (1,2),(1,3),(2,2),(2,3),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2) - SAME! So the content is NOT transposed. It's just the layout that changes. In Example 2, vertical→horizontal with reversal. In Example 3, horizontal→vertical WITHOUT reversal. That's asymmetric... unless I'm miscounting. Let me re-examine Example 2 more carefully. Input order: azure(top), red(mid), maroon(bottom). Output order: maroon(left), red(mid), azure(right). Yes, reversed. Example 3: Input order: azure(left), blue(mid), maroon(right). Output order: azure(top), blue(mid), maroon(bottom). Same order. So the rule is different for v→h vs h→v. Maybe the unifying rule is: panels are always sorted by descending size, and the layout changes. Ex1: sizes 4,6,7,10 → ascending (wait, that's ascending not descending). Hmm. Let me look at this differently. Maybe the sorting is always the same direction and I need to recount. Ex3 output: azure(6), blue(5), maroon(4) = descending. Ex1 output: red(4), green(6), yellow(7), blue(10) = ascending. These are contradictory... unless I'm miscounting sizes. Let me carefully recount. Example 3: azure panel - T shape. Cells: (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,2),(3,2),(4,2) = 6 cells. Blue panel: (0,8),(1,8),(2,8),(3,8),(4,8) in input, which is 5 cells. Relative: (0,2),(1,2),(2,2),(3,2),(4,2) = 5 cells. Maroon panel: (0,14),(1,13),(1,14),(1,15) = 4 cells. Output order: azure(6), blue(5), maroon(4) = descending order. Example 1 output order: red(4), green(6), yellow(7), blue(10) = ascending order. These are DIFFERENT! So sorting by size alone doesn't explain it. Let me reconsider. Maybe for Example 1 (2x2→vertical), the panels are sorted ascending. For linear→linear transformations, the panels keep their relative ordering. In Example 2, the panels go from vertical to horizontal - reading order for vertical is top-to-bottom, reading order for horizontal might be right-to-left? That would make: input top=azure → output right, input mid=red → output mid, input bottom=maroon → output left. Which is what we see! And in Example 3, horizontal left-to-right → vertical top-to-bottom, which preserves order directly. So the mapping is: for each panel position i in the output (reading in the output's natural order), it gets the panel at position i in the input (reading in the input's natural order). For vertical stack, natural reading order is top-to-bottom. For horizontal row, natural reading order is left-to-right. WAIT, but then Example 2 would preserve order too: input vertical top-to-bottom (azure, red, maroon) → output horizontal left-to-right should be (azure, red, maroon), but it's actually (maroon, red, azure). So that doesn't work either. Unless... the output reading order for horizontal is right-to-left? That seems arbitrary. Let me just go with hypothesis 2's case-by-case approach and verify carefully.\n",

Another approach: the product rule with grid center works for 9/10 objects. Orange in Ex2 is the sole exception, being exactly on the main diagonal of a square grid. I'll handle this by checking if the object is very close to or on the main diagonal (|r_offset/H - c_offset/W| very small compared to anti-diagonal distance), and in that case defaulting to TOP. Alternatively, the distance-to-anti-diagonal rule with threshold ~0.25-0.3 works perfectly for both examples. Let me use THAT rule: compute |r_centroid/H + c_centroid/W - 1| for each object. If this distance is less than some threshold (say 0.3 which works for both), push to TOP. Otherwise push to BOTTOM. The threshold 0.3 correctly separates all objects in both examples: Ex1 max-TOP=0.142 < 0.3 < min-BOTTOM=0.434. Ex2 max-TOP=0.226 < 0.3 < min-BOTTOM=0.313.\n",

            "Revision needed: The hypothesis works for all 3 examples, but I need to understand the unifying principle better, especially the ordering rules, before tackling the test cases. Let me reconsider: Is there a single unified rule? The issue is: Example 1 (2x2→vertical) sorts by ascending size. Example 2 (vertical→horizontal) reverses order. Example 3 (horizontal→vertical) preserves order. Wait - maybe Examples 2 and 3 also sort by size? Example 2: all sizes are 7, so any order is valid. Let me double-check the output order vs other criteria. In Example 2, the reversed order happens to be maroon(9), red(2), azure(8). By color value: 9>2 (no, not sorted by value). Example 3 output: azure(6cells), blue(5cells), maroon(4cells) = descending size. Example 1 output: red(4), green(6), yellow(7), blue(10) = ascending size. So Ex1 is ascending, Ex3 is descending? That can't be a unified rule either. UNLESS - maybe the sorting is always the same and I need to look at it differently. What if for all cases, the panels are sorted by ASCENDING size? Example 1: 4,6,7,10 ascending ✓. Example 3: The original order is 6,5,4 and the output order is 6,5,4... that's DESCENDING, not ascending. Unless I miscounted. Let me recount: azure T-shape: (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,2),(3,2),(4,2) = 6 cells. Blue line: (0,8),(1,8),(2,8),(3,8),(4,8) = 5 cells. Maroon: (0,14),(1,13),(1,14),(1,15) = 4 cells. So 6,5,4 descending in output = same as input. If sorted ascending it would be 4,5,6 (maroon,blue,azure). But the output is azure,blue,maroon. So NOT ascending. Hmm. OK wait, what if there's a DIFFERENT rule that unifies all three? What if the rule is: sort the panels by descending size? Example 1: 10,7,6,4 (blue,yellow,green,red). But output is red(4),green(6),yellow(7),blue(10). That's ascending, not descending. So that doesn't work either. OK, let me try a completely different approach. What if the panels are NOT sorted at all, and the 2x2→linear order is just reading order? 2x2 reading order could be: TL, TR, BL, BR or TL, BR, TR, BL or... For Example 1, the output order is TL, BR, TR, BL. That's a specific reading pattern. Let me think about this differently: TL(4), BR(6), TR(7), BL(10). Is this sorted? Yes, ascending by size. OR could there be another pattern? What if the 2x2 is converted by going in a spiral or zigzag? TL→BR→TR→BL... that's diagonal then anti-diagonal. Hmm, it's hard to see a geometric pattern. The ascending size sort for 2x2 still seems the best explanation for Example 1. For Examples 2 and 3, maybe the test cases will help clarify. Actually, let me reconsider Example 2 with size sorting. All three objects have 7 cells. If they're sorted by size (all equal), what determines the tiebreaker? If the tiebreaker is reverse of original order, we get: panel3, panel2, panel1 = maroon, red, azure. That IS the output! For Example 3: sizes 6,5,4 sorted descending = 6,5,4 = azure, blue, maroon. That's the output! But Example 1 sorted descending = 10,7,6,4 = blue, yellow, green, red. Output is red, green, yellow, blue = ASCENDING. So the direction differs between examples. Maybe the direction depends on the layout change? 2x2→vertical: ascending. horizontal→vertical: descending. vertical→horizontal: could be either (equal sizes). OR maybe: for vertical output, sort descending. For horizontal output... hmm, Example 1 output is ascending and it's vertical. Example 3 output is descending and it's vertical. STILL contradictory. OK let me just try: the rule is that panels maintain their order based on reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) in both input and output, EXCEPT for the 2x2 case. In the 2x2 case, the four quadrants are linearized in order of ascending size. For linear cases, the panels simply preserve their order from input's reading direction to output's reading direction. Example 2: input reading order top-to-bottom: azure, red, maroon. But output reading order left-to-right: maroon, red, azure = REVERSED. So this doesn't preserve order either! Wait... UNLESS the reading order for horizontal is right-to-left? That seems wrong. Let me look at this from a completely different angle. Maybe the transformation is literally a matrix transpose of the entire grid, except for the 2x2 case which gets sorted. Let me check Example 2: If we transpose the 17×5 input to get a 5×17 output. Row i, Col j in input → Row j, Col i in output. So input[0][0]=7 → output[0][0]=7. input[1][2]=8 → output[2][1]=8. In the actual output: output[2][1]=9. But from transpose, it should be 8. So it's NOT a simple transpose. Let me verify: input row 1 = [7,7,8,8,7]. If transposed, output col 1 = [7,7,8,8,7]. Actual output col 1: rows 0-4 = [7,9,9,9,7]. NOPE, not a transpose. OK so it's definitely extracting panels and rearranging them, not transposing pixel-by-pixel. For the linear cases, each panel is extracted as a 5×5 block and placed in the new orientation. The content of each panel is NOT transposed - it keeps its row/column structure. The question is just the ORDER. Let me try yet another theory: In Example 2 (V→H), panel order when reading right-to-left in output = azure(rightmost), red(middle), maroon(leftmost). Input reading top-to-bottom = azure(top), red(mid), maroon(bottom). So if we read the output right-to-left, it matches the input top-to-bottom! That means the first input panel maps to the LAST output position. In Example 3 (H→V), panel order reading bottom-to-top in output = maroon(bottom), blue(mid), azure(top). Input reading left-to-right = azure(left), blue(mid), maroon(right). If we read the output bottom-to-top: maroon, blue, azure. Input left-to-right: azure, blue, maroon. These DON'T match reading output bottom-to-top. Hmm. But reading output TOP-to-bottom: azure, blue, maroon = same as input left-to-right. So for H→V, the first input panel maps to the first output position. For V→H, the first input panel maps to the LAST output position. This is STILL asymmetric. Unless... wait. What if for V→H, the natural mapping goes: top input panel → top of output. But 'top' in a horizontal layout means... nothing? Or maybe: the input panel at position i (0-indexed from start) maps to output panel at position (N-1-i). Let me check: Example 2 (V→H): input panel 0 (azure) → output panel 2 (rightmost=azure) ✓. input panel 1 (red) → output panel 1 (middle=red) ✓. input panel 2 (maroon) → output panel 0 (leftmost=maroon) ✓. So it's reversed! Example 3 (H→V): input panel 0 (azure) → output panel 0 (top=azure) ✓. input panel 1 (blue) → output panel 1 (mid=blue) ✓. input panel 2 (maroon) → output panel 2 (bottom=maroon) ✓. So it's NOT reversed! This means V→H reverses but H→V doesn't. That's exactly what hypothesis 2 stated. Maybe the unifying rule is: the transformation is a 90° rotation of the panel layout (not the panel contents). In V→H, rotating the vertical strip 90° clockwise would put the top panel on the right and bottom panel on the left = reversed when reading left-to-right. In H→V, rotating the horizontal strip 90° clockwise would put the left panel on the bottom and right panel on the top = reversed when reading top-to-bottom. But Example 3 shows the LEFT panel goes to the TOP, not bottom. So it's NOT clockwise rotation. What about counterclockwise rotation? V→H counterclockwise: top→left? Example 2 has top(azure)→right(azure). NOT left. OK, 90° rotations don't explain it consistently either. Let me try: maybe V→H is just 'laying on its side' where the bottom goes to the left. That gives bottom→left, mid→mid, top→right = maroon(left), red(mid), azure(right). ✓ for Example 2! And H→V is 'standing up' where left goes to top. Left→top, mid→mid, right→bottom = azure(top), blue(mid), maroon(bottom). ✓ for Example 3! So the rule is: when going from V to H, imagine tilting the vertical strip 90° counterclockwise so the bottom rests on the ground to the left. When going from H to V, imagine tilting the horizontal strip 90° clockwise so the left end goes up. Both of these are equivalent to: the panel at the 'start' of the new reading direction corresponds to the panel at the 'start' of the input reading direction IF AND ONLY IF... hmm, actually for V→H it's reversed but for H→V it's not. Let me think about it more simply. V→H: input[top,mid,bot] → output[bot,mid,top] (reversed). H→V: input[left,mid,right] → output[left,mid,right] (same order, but now reading direction changes to top-to-bottom). Actually, the simpler explanation: in both cases, the panel at position i in the input is placed at position i in the output, where positions are numbered the same way (0=top/left, n-1=bottom/right). Example 3: input[0]=azure(left), output[0]=azure(top) ✓. Example 2: input[0]=azure(top), output[0]=maroon(left) ✗. So this doesn't work for Example 2. ALTERNATIVELY: in both cases, panels are placed so that input bottom/right → output bottom/right. Example 2: input[2]=maroon(bottom) → output[2]=azure(right) ✗. Also doesn't work. I think I need to just accept the case-by-case rule from Hypothesis 2 and verify it on the test cases.\n",

While the product rule with grid center works for 9/10 objects, it fails for orange in Ex2 which is on the main diagonal. The anti-diagonal distance rule naturally handles this case because orange is near the anti-diagonal (d=0.156 < 0.3) and goes to TOP. I'll use a threshold of 0.27 (midpoint of 0.226 and 0.313) or check if there's a natural gap in the distances for each input.

            "Revision needed: I need to think more carefully about what happens with Test 2 (23x5, 4 vertical panels). Let me reconsider whether there's actually a unified rule I'm missing. Let me re-examine the V→H reversal case (Example 2) vs H→V same-order case (Example 3). What if the actual rule is: ALL panels are sorted by ascending object size, but for linear layouts with distinct sizes, I need to recheck. Example 3 output order is azure(6), blue(5), maroon(4) which is DESCENDING, not ascending. But Example 1 output is ascending. So ascending sort clearly doesn't unify them. Wait - what if I'm wrong about Example 2 being a reversal, and it's actually ALSO a size sort, but I just can't tell because sizes are equal? If sizes are equal, any order could result from a sort. So maybe: Example 1 sorts by ascending size ✓. Example 2 sorts by ascending size (all equal, so any order is valid) ✓. Example 3: sizes are 6,5,4 and output is 6,5,4. If sorted ascending, should be 4,5,6. So Example 3 does NOT sort ascending. UNLESS... I'm reading Example 3 wrong. Let me triple-check. Input panels left to right: cols 0-4 have azure(8) T-shape. Let me count carefully: row0 cols 0-4: [7,7,7,7,7] - no azure cells. row1 cols 0-4: [7,8,8,8,7] - 3 azure cells. row2 cols 0-4: [7,7,8,7,7] - 1 azure cell. row3 cols 0-4: [7,7,8,7,7] - 1 azure cell. row4 cols 0-4: [7,7,8,7,7] - 1 azure cell. Total: 6 azure cells. Panel 2 (cols 6-10): row0: [7,7,1,7,7] - 1. row1: [7,7,1,7,7] - 1. row2: [7,7,1,7,7] - 1. row3: [7,7,1,7,7] - 1. row4: [7,7,1,7,7] - 1. Total: 5. Panel 3 (cols 12-16): row0: [7,7,9,7,7] - 1. row1: [7,9,9,9,7] - 3. row2-4: all 7s. Total: 4. Ascending sort: 4(maroon), 5(blue), 6(azure). But output order top to bottom: azure(6), blue(5), maroon(4) = DESCENDING. So my hypothesis 2 is correct for this case - H→V preserves order, which happens to be descending by size. Let me also wonder: maybe the rule is simpler. ALL cases sort by DESCENDING size? Example 1: desc = 10,7,6,4 (blue,yellow,green,red). But output = red(4),green(6),yellow(7),blue(10) = ascending! So desc doesn't work for Example 1 either. Hmm, OK here's another idea. What if the rule is ALWAYS ascending size sort, and Example 3 is in ascending order when reading the output BOTTOM to TOP? Bottom to top: maroon(4), blue(5), azure(6) = ascending! And Example 1 top to bottom: red(4), green(6), yellow(7), blue(10) = ascending. And Example 2 right to left: azure(7), red(7), maroon(7) = all equal. So maybe for vertical output, read bottom-to-top for the ascending order. For horizontal output, read right-to-left. That means: output position [last] = smallest, output position [first] = largest? Example 1 vertical output: position 0 (top) = red(4) = smallest, position 3 (bottom) = blue(10) = largest. That's smallest at top, largest at bottom = ascending top-to-bottom. For Example 3 vertical output: position 0 (top) = azure(6) = largest, position 2 (bottom) = maroon(4) = smallest. That's largest at top, smallest at bottom = DESCENDING top-to-bottom. These are OPPOSITE. So the bottom-to-top reading idea works for Example 3 but contradicts Example 1. I'm going in circles. Let me try a completely different approach. What if the ordering is determined by something other than size? What about position in the original grid? Example 1: TL→position 0, BR→position 1, TR→position 2, BL→position 3. What property of these positions gives this order? TL=(0,0), BR=(1,1), TR=(0,1), BL=(1,0). Maybe reading in diagonal order? Main diagonal first (TL, BR), then anti-diagonal (TR, BL)? That gives TL, BR, TR, BL which matches! But that's specific to the 2x2 case. Let me verify: TL(row0,col0), BR(row1,col1), TR(row0,col1), BL(row1,col0). Is there a numeric ordering? If we assign each quadrant the value row+col: TL=0, TR=1, BL=1, BR=2. Then sorted: TL(0), TR/BL(1,1), BR(2). But output is TL, BR, TR, BL not TL, TR, BL, BR. So that doesn't work. What about row*2+col? TL=0, TR=1, BL=2, BR=3. Sorted: TL, TR, BL, BR. But output is TL, BR, TR, BL. Not matching. What about the size? TL=4, TR=7, BL=10, BR=6. Sorted: 4,6,7,10 = TL,BR,TR,BL. YES, this is ascending size sort. OK so for 2x2, it's definitely size sort. For the linear cases, let me just accept: V→H reverses, H→V preserves. I'll proceed with this. For Test 2 (23x5, 4 vertical panels), following the V→H reversal rule: the 4 panels will be reversed and placed horizontally. Let me now compute what the test outputs should be and proceed to implement.\"}\n",

            "Revision needed: I need to more precisely define: (1) How to identify the template vs content blocks, (2) How to extract interiors from each block, (3) How to determine the concatenation arrangement (1D horizontal vs 2D grid). Let me also reconsider whether the 'L-frame' approach from Example 2 applies to Example 1. \\n\\nIn Example 1, the template has a multi-panel structure (top frame, middle divider, bottom frame, left border) with two fill colors. Content blocks have partial frames and match one fill color each.\\n\\nIn Example 2, the template is a single 3x3 with L-frame and single fill color. Other blocks are also 3x3 with L-frames pointing in different directions.\\n\\nThe key difference: Example 1 has a template with MULTIPLE panels (2 rows), while Example 2 has MULTIPLE blocks arranged in a 2D grid.\\n\\nMaybe the unifying rule is:\\n1. Find all non-background rectangular regions\\n2. The template is the one with the MOST COMPLEX frame (has dividers creating multiple panels) - or if all blocks are similar, the one with yellow\\n3. Content from other blocks is concatenated into the template's panels\\n4. For multi-panel templates: content is grouped by fill color and concatenated horizontally per panel\\n5. For single-panel templates: content from all blocks (including template) is assembled in a 2D grid based on their spatial arrangement\\n6. Output is placed with 2-cell margin at bottom-right of grid\\n\\nActually, I think the unifying rule is simpler than I think. Let me reconsider.\\n\\nIn BOTH examples:\\n- There's a frame color (orange/green) that forms borders\\n- Content goes inside the borders\\n- The template defines the overall output structure\\n- Other blocks provide additional content\\n\\nI think the key might be that the template's FRAME structure defines rows and columns of panels, and each content block fills one panel or adds to one panel.\\n\\nFor Example 1:\\n- Template has 2 rows × 1 col of panels. Each panel is 2×4.\\n- Content blocks: 1 for the top panel, 2 for the bottom panel.\\n- Top: template (4) + block B (5) = 9 wide.\\n- Bottom: template (4) + block C (3) + block D (2) = 9 wide.\\n\\nFor Example 2:\\n- Template is 1 panel, 2×2.\\n- 3 other blocks, each 2×2 content.\\n- Arranged in a 2×2 grid of panels.\\n\\nBut how to determine the arrangement? In Example 2, it's based on the L-frame direction. In Example 1, it's based on content color matching the template panels.\\n\\nI think I have enough understanding to implement. Let me proceed with verification and then implementation.\\n\\nActually, I realize I should verify more carefully. In Example 2, I said:\\n- Each block has an L-frame pointing in a specific direction\\n- The block goes to the position matching its frame direction\\n- Content is the 2×2 opposite the frame\\n\\nLet me verify the content placement more carefully.\\n\\nTL block [3,3,3/3,9,9/3,9,9]: frame = top row + left col.

Goes to TR of 4×4.\\nBR block [3,9,9/3,9,3/3,3,3]: frame = bottom row + left col. Content at (0-1,1-2) = [9,9/9,3]. Goes to BL of 4×4.\\nTR block [9,9,3/3,3,3/3,3,3]: frame = bottom row + right col. Wait, (2,2)=3 and more. Let me re-examine.\\n\\nTR block:\\nRow 0: 9,9,3\\nRow 1: 3,3,3\\nRow 2: 3,3,3\\n\\nThe 3-cells form an inverted-L: rows 1-2 (all 3) + col 2 (all 3). That's bottom 2 rows + right col. Frame includes row 1, row 2, and col 2.\\n\\nThe L-frame consists of one full row + one full column forming an L-shape. For TL, it's row 0 + col 0. For TR, it's... row 2 + col 2 (bottom row + right col)? But rows 1 and 2 are both all 3. The 'L' is row 2 + col 2, but row 1 is also all 3. So the 'frame' takes up more space than expected.\\n\\nActually, the frame should be identified as the single row + single column that form the L. The remaining area should be the interior.\\n\\nFor a 3×3 block, an L-frame takes 1 row + 1 col = 5 cells, leaving a 2×2 interior.\\n\\nTL: row 0 (3,3,3) + col 0 (3,3) [rows 1-2] = 5 cells of frame. Interior (1-2,1-2): [9,9/9,9]. ✓\\n\\nTR: Need to find which row+col combo gives the L-frame. \\nOption: row 0 + col 2. Frame cells: (0,0)=9,(0,1)=9,(0,2)=3,(1,2)=3,(2,2)=3. Only 3 frame cells (col 2) but row 0 has 9s.\\nOption: row 2 + col 2. Frame: (2,0)=3,(2,1)=3,(2,2)=3,(0,2)=3,(1,2)=3. All 3! Interior (0-1,0-1): [9,9/3,3]. Has 2 maroon, 2 green.\\nOption: row 1 + col 2. Frame: (1,0)=3,(1,1)=3,(1,2)=3,(0,2)=3,(2,2)=3. All 3! Interior: rows {0,2} × cols {0,1}: [(0,0)=9,(0,1)=9,(2,0)=3,(2,1)=3]. Not a contiguous 2×2 block.\\n\\nSo for TR, the best L-frame is row 2 + col 2. This gives interior (0-1,0-1): [9,9/3,3].\\n\\nFrame position: bottom-right. In the output, this goes to the BR position of the 4×4.\\nBR quadrant (2-3,2-3): [9,9/3,3].\\nActual output: (2,2)=9,(2,3)=9,(3,2)=3,(3,3)=3. ✓!\\n\\nBL block [3,3,3/9,9,3/9,9,3]:\\nFrame options:\\n- Row 0 + col 2: (0,0)=3,(0,1)=3,(0,2)=3,(1,2)=3,(2,2)=3. All 3! Interior (1-2,0-1): [9,9/9,9].\\nFrame position: top-right. Goes to TR of output.\\nTR quadrant (0-1,2-3): [9,9/9,9]. ✓!\\n\\nBR block [3,9,9/3,9,3/3,3,3]:\\nFrame options:\\n- Row 2 + col 0: (2,0)=3,(2,1)=3,(2,2)=3,(0,0)=3,(1,0)=3. All 3! Interior (0-1,1-2): [9,9/9,3].\\nFrame position: bottom-left. Goes to BL of output.\\nBL quadrant (2-3,0-1): [9,9/9,3] → (2,0)=9,(2,1)=9,(3,0)=9,(3,1)=3. \\nExpected: (row 5, cols 3-4 of output) = (5,3)=9,(5,4)=9,(6,3)=9,(6,4)=3.\\nOutput row 5: [8,8,3,9,9,9,9,3,8,8] → (5,3)=9 ✓\\nOutput row 6: [8,8,3,9,3,3,3,3,8,8] → (6,3)=9, (6,4)=3 ✓\\n\\nWait, (3,1) of the 4×4 should be 3. In the output, (6,4)=3. Let me map: 4×4 interior starts at row 3, col 3 of the output grid. (3,0)→(6,3), (3,1)→(6,4). (3,1)=3, (6,4)=3. ✓!\\n\\nEverything checks out for Example 2.\\n\\nNow, for Example 1, the approach is different because the template has multiple panels. Let me formalize:\\n\\nExample 1 approach:\\n1. Template = the block with multiple horizontal panels (identified by having frame-color dividers)\\n2. Each panel is associated with a fill color\\n3. Other blocks match a panel by their fill color\\n4. Content is concatenated horizontally (template first, then others by row position)\\n5. Frame expands to accommodate\\n\\nExample 2 approach:\\n1. Template = the block marked by yellow (only one with extra attached color)\\n2. All blocks have L-frames; the frame position determines placement\\n3. Content (2×2 interior) is placed in the corresponding quadrant of the output interior\\n4. Frame color border wraps everything\\n\\nThese seem like different rules. Can they be unified?\\n\\nMaybe the unifying principle is:\\n- All blocks have frames (made of the structural/frame color)\\n- Each block has an interior (non-frame region)\\n- The output assembles all interiors into a single frame\\n- The arrangement is determined by the spatial layout of blocks in the input\\n\\nIn Example 1:\\n- Template has vertical frame on left + horizontal frame on top/middle/bottom\\n- Other blocks have partial frames\\n- Blocks are assembled by matching their fill color to the appropriate panel\\n\\nIn Example 2:\\n- Each block has an L-frame\\n- Each block's L-frame indicates its 'corner' position\\n- Blocks are assembled into a 2×2 grid based on corner positions\\n\\nI think the more general principle might be:\\n1. Each block has a frame and an interior\\n2. The frames indicate how blocks connect to each other\\n3. Blocks are assembled so their frames merge into one continuous frame\\n4. Interiors are placed adjacent to each other\\n\\nFor Example 2:\\n- TL block's L-frame points top-left → placed at top-left corner, frame faces out\\n- TR block's L-frame points bottom-right → placed at bottom-right corner, frame faces out\\n- BL block's L-frame points top-right → placed at top-right corner, frame faces out\\n- BR block's L-frame points bottom-left → placed at bottom-left corner, frame faces out\\n\\nThe frames merge: TL's top row merges with BL's (TR's) top row to form the output's top border. Etc.\\n\\nFor Example 1:\\nI need to think of the blocks differently. The template is a complex frame with 2 panels. The content blocks are simpler.\\n\\nActually, maybe I should just implement both patterns and handle them case by case. Or perhaps there's a simpler unifying principle.\\n\\nLet me think about this differently. What if the core rule is:\\n\\n1. Find all blocks (connected non-background regions)\\n2. One block has yellow - this is special\\n3. For each non-yellow block, extract its content (the non-frame interior)\\n4. The output is a new frame containing all the content, concatenated\\n5. Content with the same height gets concatenated horizontally\\n6. Content with the same width gets concatenated vertically\\n7. The yellow indicates something to be excluded or just marks the template\\n\\nI think for implementation, I need to handle the general case. Let me think about what's truly common:\\n\\n- Background color (8 in both)\\n- Frame color (7 or 3) \\n- Fill colors (0,2 or 9)\\n- Yellow(4) marks something special\\n- Output is on clean background\\n- Output has frame_color border around assembled content\\n\\nI think the most robust approach is:\\n1. Identify all rectangular regions on the background\\n2. One region has yellow attached → it's the template\\n3. Template defines the frame structure (how many rows/cols of panels)\\n4. Extract interiors from all regions\\n5. Assemble interiors based on the template structure\\n6. Build output\\n\\nFor now, let me proceed with implementation and handle the test cases. I'll need to be flexible in my approach.\\n\\nActually, I realize I should look at the test inputs to understand what patterns I need to handle. Let me proceed to implementation with what I have.\n",

            "Reasoning: The threshold-based quadrant approach works but feels hacky. Let me think more carefully. What if instead of a product threshold, there's a cleaner geometric criterion? \\n\\nLet me reconsider the MAIN DIAGONAL approach (hypothesis #2 from the perceiver): shapes closer to the main diagonal go to bottom, shapes closer to the anti-diagonal go to top.\\n\\nMain diagonal distance: |r/H - c/W|\\nAnti-diagonal distance: |r/H + c/W - 1|\\n\\nEx1: Yellow(5.5/28=0.196, 0.5/19=0.026): main_d=|0.196-0.026|=0.170, anti_d=|0.196+0.026-1|=0.778. main < anti \\u2192 closer to main diagonal \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nRed(7/28=0.250, 6/19=0.316): main_d=|0.250-0.316|=0.066, anti_d=|0.250+0.316-1|=0.434. main < anti \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nBlue(11.43/28=0.408, 13/19=0.684): main_d=|0.408-0.684|=0.276, anti_d=|0.408+0.684-1|=0.092. main > anti \\u2192 closer to anti-diagonal \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nGreen(19/28=0.679, 3.57/19=0.188): main_d=|0.679-0.188|=0.491, anti_d=|0.679+0.188-1|=0.133. main > anti \\u2192 top \\u2713\\n\\nALL MATCH for Ex1! Let me check Ex2:\\n\\nBlue(5.75/30=0.192, 5.25/30=0.175): main_d=|0.192-0.175|=0.017, anti_d=|0.192+0.175-1|=0.633. main < anti \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nGreen(4.22/30=0.141, 23/30=0.767): main_d=|0.141-0.767|=0.626, anti_d=|0.141+0.767-1|=0.092. main > anti \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nOrange(12.67/30=0.422, 12.67/30=0.422): main_d=|0.422-0.422|=0.0, anti_d=|0.422+0.422-1|=0.156. main < anti \\u2192 bottom... but orange goes TOP! \\u2717\\n\\nStill fails for orange! \\n\\nHmm, wait. Let me reconsider orange. Orange is at (12.67, 12.67) - it's exactly ON the main diagonal. Could there be a tie-breaking rule? Or am I wrong about the output?\\n\\nLet me re-examine the output for orange. Output row 0 col 13 = 7 (orange), row 1 cols 12-13 = 7. So orange IS at top.\\n\\nWhat if the rule is about which SIDE of the anti-diagonal the object falls, rather than distance comparison? Objects above the anti-diagonal (r/H + c/W < 1) go bottom, objects below (>= 1) go top?\\n\\nOrange: 0.422 + 0.422 = 0.844 < 1 \\u2192 bottom. Still wrong.\\n\\nLet me try the opposite: above anti-diagonal \\u2192 top, below anti-diagonal \\u2192 bottom.\\nYellow: 0.222 < 1 \\u2192 top. But yellow goes BOTTOM. Wrong.\\n\\nWhat if I use (r + c) compared to (H + W - 2)/2 or some other center measure?\\n\\nActually, let me reconsider. What about using the center of the bounding box instead of centroid? Orange bounding box: rows 12-13, cols 12-13. BB center = (12.5, 12.5). This doesn't change much.\\n\\nLet me try another approach entirely. What if the rule is simply: upper half \\u2192 bottom, lower half \\u2192 top? And for objects straddling the center line, use column position?\\n\\nEx1 center row = 14 (H=28, center=13.5):\\nYellow center 5.5 < 13.5 (upper) \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nRed center 7.0 < 13.5 (upper) \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nBlue center 11.43 < 13.5 (upper) \\u2192 bottom... but blue goes TOP \\u2717\\n\\nDoesn't work. Let me think differently.\\n\\nWhat if the diagonal comparison uses the raw coordinates, not normalized? Main diagonal: r = c*(H/W). Distance to main diagonal: |r - c*H/W|. Anti-diagonal: r = H - c*H/W. Distance to anti-diagonal: |r - (H - c*H/W)|.\\n\\nEx1 (H=28, W=19, H/W \\u2248 1.474):\\nYellow(5.5, 0.5): main_d=|5.5-0.5*1.474|=|5.5-0.737|=4.763, anti_d=|5.5-(28-0.737)|=|5.5-27.263|=21.763. main < anti \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nRed(7.0, 6.0): main_d=|7.0-6.0*1.474|=|7.0-8.842|=1.842, anti_d=|7.0-(28-8.842)|=|7.0-19.158|=12.158. main < anti \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nBlue(11.43, 13.0): main_d=|11.43-13.0*1.474|=|11.43-19.158|=7.728, anti_d=|11.43-(28-19.158)|=|11.43-8.842|=2.588. main > anti \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nGreen(19.0, 3.57): main_d=|19.0-3.57*1.474|=|19.0-5.262|=13.738, anti_d=|19.0-(28-5.262)|=|19.0-22.738|=3.738. main > anti \\u2192 top \\u2713\\n\\nEx2 (H=30, W=30, H/W=1.0):\\nBlue(5.75, 5.25): main_d=|5.75-5.25|=0.5, anti_d=|5.75-(30-5.25)|=|5.75-24.75|=19.0. main < anti \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nGreen(4.22, 23.0): main_d=|4.22-23.0|=18.78, anti_d=|4.22-(30-23.0)|=|4.22-7.0|=2.78. main > anti \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nOrange(12.67, 12.67): main_d=|12.67-12.67|=0.0, anti_d=|12.67-(30-12.67)|=|12.67-17.33|=4.67. main < anti \\u2192 bottom... but orange goes TOP \\u2717\\n\\nStill fails! Orange is exactly on the main diagonal. Product is exactly 0 for this diagonal test.\\n\\nOK let me reconsider. What if it's NOT about diagonals at all? Let me look at the actual pattern more carefully.\\n\\nEx2 destinations:\\n- Blue (upper-left) \\u2192 bottom\\n- Green (upper-right) \\u2192 top  \\n- Orange (center, slightly upper-left) \\u2192 top\\n- Maroon (center, slightly upper-right) \\u2192 top\\n- Red (lower-left) \\u2192 top\\n- Yellow (lower-right) \\u2192 bottom\\n\\nBottom: Blue (UL far from center), Yellow (LR far from center)\\nTop: Green (UR), Orange (slightly UL near center), Maroon (slightly UR near center), Red (LL)\\n\\nHmm, the bottom ones are in UL-LR diagonal, top ones are in UR-LL diagonal or NEAR CENTER...\\n\\nWhat if the rule is: compute signed distance to main diagonal (not absolute). If above the main diagonal, go to top. If below or on the main diagonal, go to bottom.\\n\\nMain diagonal: r = c (for square grid). Above diagonal means r < c.\\n\\nEx2: Blue (12.67, 12.67): r = c, ON diagonal. Hmm.\\n\\nActually wait - orange is 3 cells. (12,13),(13,12),(13,13). Using bounding box center: ((12+13)/2, (12+13)/2) = (12.5, 12.5). Using centroid: ((12+13+13)/3, (13+12+13)/3) = (12.67, 12.67). Both are approximately on the diagonal.\\n\\nMaybe the tie-breaking for 'on the diagonal' is that it goes to top? Or maybe the exact center matters?\\n\\nLet me try: above main diagonal (r < c*H/W) \\u2192 top, below or on \\u2192 bottom.\\n\\nEx2 (square, H/W=1): r < c \\u2192 top\\nBlue(5.75, 5.25): 5.75 > 5.25 \\u2192 below \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nGreen(4.22, 23.0): 4.22 < 23.0 \\u2192 above \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nOrange(12.67, 12.67): 12.67 = 12.67 \\u2192 on/below \\u2192 bottom \\u2717 (goes top)\\n\\nAlternatively: r < c \\u2192 top, r > c \\u2192 bottom, r = c \\u2192 ???\\n\\nLet me try: r <= c \\u2192 top, r > c \\u2192 bottom.\\nBlue: 5.75 > 5.25 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nGreen: 4.22 < 23 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nOrange (centroid): 12.67 = 12.67 \\u2192 top (with <=) \\u2713!\\nMaroon: 12.33 < 16.33 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nRed: 18.0 > 5.22 \\u2192 bottom \\u2717 (goes top)\\n\\nFails for red.\\n\\nHmm. Let me try anti-diagonal: r + c compared to H-1 (or H/2 + W/2, etc.).\\n\\nUse r + c*H/W compared to H:\\nEx2: Blue: 5.75 + 5.25 = 11.0 < 30 \\u2192 ?\\nRed: 18.0 + 5.22 = 23.22 < 30 \\u2192 ?\\n\\nLet me try: r + c < (H+W)/2 \\u2192 bottom, r + c >= (H+W)/2 \\u2192 top.\\nEx2 (H+W)/2 = 30:\\nBlue: 5.75+5.25=11.0 < 30 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nGreen: 4.22+23.0=27.22 < 30 \\u2192 bottom \\u2717 (goes top)\\n\\nDoesn't work.\\n\\nLet me try: compute the angle from center to object. If the angle puts it in the upper-left or lower-right sector (main diagonal direction), go bottom. If in upper-right or lower-left sector (anti-diagonal direction), go top. The sectors are divided by r=c and r=-c (centered).\\n\\nThis is essentially the quadrant rule. But orange fails because it's essentially at the center.\\n\\nActually, let me use bounding box center for orange instead of centroid:\\nOrange BB: rows 12-13, cols 12-13. BB center: (12.5, 12.5).\\nGrid center: (14.5, 14.5) for 30x30 grid (using (H-1)/2, (W-1)/2).\\n\\nWith grid center as (14.5, 14.5):\\nOrange offset: (12.5-14.5, 12.5-14.5) = (-2, -2). Product = (-2)*(-2) = 4 > 0 \\u2192 bottom. Still fails.\\n\\nBut what if I use (H-1)/2 for center? Let me redo ALL:\\n\\nEx2, center = (14.5, 14.5):\\nBlue BB center: (5.5, 5). Product: (5.5-14.5)*(5-14.5) = (-9)*(-9.5) = 85.5 > 0 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nGreen BB center: (4.5, 23). Product: (4.5-14.5)*(23-14.5) = (-10)*(8.5) = -85 < 0 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nOrange BB center: (12.5, 12.5). Product: (-2)*(-2) = 4 > 0 \\u2192 bottom \\u2717\\nMaroon BB center: (12.5, 16.5). Product: (-2)*(2) = -4 < 0 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nRed BB center: (18, 5.5). Product: (3.5)*(-9) = -31.5 < 0 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nYellow BB center: (18, 21). Product: (3.5)*(6.5) = 22.75 > 0 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\n\\nOrange is the ONLY failure. Its product is only 4, very small.\\n\\nWhat about using actual cell positions to determine something? Orange cells: (12,13),(13,12),(13,13). What if the rule is about where the majority of cells fall relative to the diagonal? \\n\\nDiagonal: r = c (relative to center, so centered diagonal). Centered coords: (-2,-2), (-1.5,-2.5) wait that's getting complicated.\\n\\nHmm, actually, what if the key insight is that orange and maroon are PAIRED (they're mirror images of each other at similar rows), and they BOTH go to top because they form a pair? In Ex1, the red cells form a single composite object, and blue/green are separate.\\n\\nLet me reconsider from scratch. Maybe the classification isn't based on position at all, but on the SHAPE of the object. Objects pointing in certain directions go certain ways?\\n\\nAlternatively, what if objects that are in the upper half go to the bottom and lower half go to the top (vertical flip), UNLESS an object is very close to the center, in which case some other rule applies?\\n\\nActually let me re-read the perceiver's hypothesis #1 more carefully: \\\"if (r - H/2) * (c - W/2) > 0 (upper-left or lower-right quadrant), push to BOTTOM edge. If the product < 0 (upper-right or lower-left quadrant), push to TOP edge.\\\"\\n\\nBut for orange, the product is positive (upper-left quadrant) and it goes to TOP. What if there's a simpler interpretation?\\n\\nWait, what if I should look at it differently. What if there's a threshold based on magnitude? Small positive products go to TOP?\\n\\nAll products across both examples:\\nEx1: Yellow +76.5\\u2192bottom, Red +24.5\\u2192bottom, Blue -9.0\\u2192top, Green -29.65\\u2192top\\nEx2: Blue +90.19\\u2192bottom, Green -86.24\\u2192top, Orange +5.43\\u2192top, Maroon -3.55\\u2192top, Red -29.33\\u2192top, Yellow +20.4\\u2192bottom\\n\\nSo bottom objects have products: +76.5, +24.5, +90.19, +20.4. Min = +20.4.\\nTop objects with positive products: +5.43. Top objects with negative: -9.0, -29.65, -86.24, -3.55, -29.33.\\n\\nSo it seems like a threshold of ~10 works: product > 10 \\u2192 bottom, product <= 10 \\u2192 top. But this threshold seems arbitrary.\\n\\nActually, what if the rule uses the SIGN of the product but with a slight twist: the product is computed using integer grid center (H//2, W//2) instead of H/2?\\n\\nEx2: H=30, W=30. H//2=15, W//2=15.\\nOrange centroid: (12.67, 12.67). Product: (12.67-15)*(12.67-15) = (-2.33)*(-2.33) = 5.43. Same.\\n\\nWhat about using min_row instead of centroid?\\nOrange min_row=12, min_col=12. Product: (12-15)*(12-15) = 9. Still positive.\\n\\nWhat about max_row? Max_row=13, max_col=13. Product: (13-15)*(13-15) = 4. Still positive.\\n\\nLet me try the TOP-LEFT corner of the bounding box:\\nOrange: (12, 12). Product with center (15,15): (-3)*(-3) = 9 > 0 \\u2192 bottom. Still fails.\\n\\nI'm stuck on orange. Let me look at this completely differently.\\n\\nWhat if the rule is: push each object to the edge that is FARTHER from it (in terms of bounding box)?\\n\\nOrange: rows 12-13. Distance to top: 12. Distance to bottom: 30-1-13=16. So farther from bottom \\u2192 push to bottom? But orange goes to top.\\n\\nOr closer edge? 12 < 16, so closer to top \\u2192 push to top? Let me check all:\\n\\nEx2:\\nBlue rows 5-6: dist_top=5, dist_bot=23. Closer to top \\u2192 top? But blue goes bottom. \\u2717\\n\\nDoesn't work either.\\n\\nWait, let me re-examine the OUTPUT of Example 2 more carefully.\\n\\nOutput row 0: [5,5,5,5,2,2,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,7,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5]\\n- Red at cols 4-6\\n- Orange at col 13\\n- Maroon at cols 16-17\\n- Green at cols 22-24\\n\\nOutput row 1: [5,5,5,5,2,5,2,2,5,5,5,5,7,7,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,3,5,5,5,5,5]\\n- Red at cols 4,6,7\\n- Orange at cols 12-13\\n- Maroon at col 16\\n- Green at cols 22,24\\n\\nOutput row 2: [5,5,5,5,2,2,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5]\\n- Red at cols 4-6\\n- Green at cols 22-24\\n\\nOutput row 3: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5]\\n- Green at col 23\\n\\nSo yes, red, orange, maroon, green all go to top. Let me check if they share something.\\n\\nRed: lower-left. Orange: center-left (slightly). Maroon: center-right (slightly). Green: upper-right.\\n\\nWhat do the bottom ones share? Blue: upper-left. Yellow: lower-right.\\n\\nUpper-left + lower-right = main diagonal direction. These go to bottom.\\nUpper-right + lower-left + center = anti-diagonal direction + center. These go to top.\\n\\nSo the pattern is about which diagonal 'sector' the object is in. Objects in the main diagonal sector (UL, LR) go to bottom. Objects in the anti-diagonal sector (UR, LL) go to top. And center objects... also go to top?\\n\\nOr more precisely, the dividing line is the MAIN DIAGONAL. Objects BELOW the main diagonal (r > c when centered) go to... let me check.\\n\\nUsing centered coords (relative to grid center H/2, W/2):\\nEx2: center (15,15).\\nBlue: (5.75-15, 5.25-15) = (-9.25, -9.75). Below diagonal (r > c relative)? -9.25 > -9.75 yes \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nGreen: (4.22-15, 23-15) = (-10.78, 8). Above diagonal (r < c)? -10.78 < 8 yes \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nOrange: (12.67-15, 12.67-15) = (-2.33, -2.33). ON diagonal \\u2192 ?\\nMaroon: (12.33-15, 16.33-15) = (-2.67, 1.33). Above (r < c)? -2.67 < 1.33 yes \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nRed: (18-15, 5.22-15) = (3, -9.78). Below (r > c)? 3 > -9.78 yes \\u2192 bottom? But red goes TOP \\u2717\\n\\nHmm, that doesn't work for red either.\\n\\nOK let me try: objects ABOVE the main diagonal (r_centered < c_centered) go to TOP, objects BELOW (r_centered > c_centered) go to BOTTOM.\\n\\nEx2:\\nBlue: -9.25 < -9.75? No (-9.25 > -9.75) \\u2192 below \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nGreen: -10.78 < 8? Yes \\u2192 above \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nOrange: -2.33 < -2.33? No (equal) \\u2192 below/on \\u2192 bottom \\u2717\\nMaroon: -2.67 < 1.33? Yes \\u2192 above \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nRed: 3 < -9.78? No \\u2192 below \\u2192 bottom \\u2717 (goes top)\\n\\nFails for both orange and red.\\n\\nLet me try: objects ABOVE the ANTI-diagonal (r_centered + c_centered < 0) go to BOTTOM, objects BELOW (r_centered + c_centered > 0) go to TOP.\\n\\nEx2:\\nBlue: -9.25 + -9.75 = -19 < 0 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nGreen: -10.78 + 8 = -2.78 < 0 \\u2192 bottom \\u2717 (goes top)\\n\\nDoesn't work.\\n\\nLet me try another approach: r_centered + c_centered > 0 \\u2192 bottom.\\nBlue: -19 \\u2192 not > 0 \\u2192 top \\u2717\\n\\nNope.\\n\\nI'm going in circles. Let me go back to the product approach and think about what makes orange different.\\n\\nProducts in Ex2:\\n- Blue: +90.19 \\u2192 bottom\\n- Yellow: +20.4 \\u2192 bottom\\n- Orange: +5.43 \\u2192 TOP (anomaly!)\\n- Maroon: -3.55 \\u2192 top\\n- Red: -29.33 \\u2192 top\\n- Green: -86.24 \\u2192 top\\n\\nWhat if the threshold isn't a fixed number but is relative to the grid? Like, the product must exceed (H*W)/100 or something? 30*30/100 = 9. Orange at +5.43 < 9 \\u2192 top. Blue at +90.19 > 9 \\u2192 bottom. Yellow at +20.4 > 9 \\u2192 bottom. \\u2713 for Ex2!\\n\\nEx1: 28*19/100 = 5.32. Yellow +76.5 > 5.32 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713. Red +24.5 > 5.32 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713. Blue -9.0 < 5.32 \\u2192 top \\u2713. Green -29.65 < 5.32 \\u2192 top \\u2713. \\u2713!\\n\\nBut what threshold exactly? For Ex2: threshold between 5.43 and 20.4. For Ex1: threshold between -9.0 and 24.5 (everything negative is below, everything positive is above in Ex1).\\n\\nActually, for Ex1 ALL objects with negative products go top, ALL with positive go bottom. There is no 'weakly positive' case. The threshold could be 0, and it works for Ex1.\\n\\nThe issue is ONLY orange in Ex2 with product +5.43. Is there something special about orange?\\n\\nLet me look at orange more carefully. Orange cells: (12,13),(13,12),(13,13). This is an L-shape. In the output, it's at (0,13),(1,12),(1,13) - pushed to top.\\n\\nHmm, what if I should be looking at this in terms of which objects are 'paired'? In Ex2, orange and maroon are at the same rows (12-13) and seem to be mirror images. Perhaps they're treated as a pair and both go in the same direction?\\n\\nIf I merge orange+maroon into one object: cells at (12,13),(13,12),(13,13),(12,16),(12,17),(13,16). Centroid: rows=(12+13+13+12+12+13)/6=75/6=12.5, cols=(13+12+13+16+17+16)/6=87/6=14.5. Product: (12.5-15)*(14.5-15) = (-2.5)*(-0.5) = +1.25. Still positive but very small.\\n\\nWhat if objects are grouped by color similarity or spatial proximity, and the group's product determines direction?\\n\\nActually, let me reconsider. Maybe the threshold is 0 but with a slight modification: product = (centroid_r - H/2) * (centroid_c - W/2) where we use STRICT inequality: product > 0 \\u2192 bottom, product < 0 \\u2192 top, and product \\u2248 0 \\u2192 top (default).\\n\\nOrange's product using centroid: (12.67-15)*(12.67-15) = (-2.33)^2 = 5.43. This IS positive.\\n\\nBut what if I use the BOUNDING BOX center with different rounding?\\n\\nOK, I've been going around in circles. Let me try a completely different approach: maybe the rule involves the SHAPE DIRECTION/ORIENTATION rather than position.\\n\\nYellow(4) in Ex1: L-shape pointing down-right \\u2192 bottom\\nRed(2) in Ex1: 3x3 block with diagonal satellites \\u2192 bottom\\nBlue(1) in Ex1: inverted T (stem goes down) \\u2192 top\\nGreen(3) in Ex1: cross with left arm (points left) \\u2192 top\\n\\nHmm, no clear directional pattern.\\n\\nLet me try yet another approach: what if it's about the COLOR value?\\n\\nEx1: Color 4 \\u2192 bottom, Color 2 \\u2192 bottom, Color 1 \\u2192 top, Color 3 \\u2192 top.\\nEx2: Color 1 \\u2192 bottom, Color 3 \\u2192 top, Color 7 \\u2192 top, Color 9 \\u2192 top, Color 2 \\u2192 top, Color 4 \\u2192 bottom.\\n\\nColor 1: bottom in Ex2, top in Ex1. Not consistent. Color isn't the rule.\\n\\nLet me try: number of cells.\\nEx1: Yellow(5)\\u2192bottom, Red(11)\\u2192bottom, Blue(7)\\u2192top, Green(7)\\u2192top.\\nEx2: Blue(4)\\u2192bottom, Green(9)\\u2192top, Orange(3)\\u2192top, Maroon(3)\\u2192top, Red(9)\\u2192top, Yellow(5)\\u2192bottom.\\n\\nBottom: 5,11,4,5. Top: 7,7,9,3,3,9. No clear size pattern.\\n\\nOK, I'm going to go with the quadrant product approach and set a threshold. Let me be more precise about the threshold.\\n\\nAll products sorted:\\nTop: -86.24, -29.65, -29.33, -9.0, -3.55, +5.43\\nBottom: +20.4, +24.5, +76.5, +90.19\\n\\nThe threshold is between 5.43 and 20.4. Perhaps the threshold is based on some fraction of the grid area or dimension.\\n\\nGrid areas: Ex1 = 28*19 = 532. Ex2 = 30*30 = 900.\\n\\nH or W based: maybe threshold = min(H,W)/2? Ex2: min(30,30)/2=15. 5.43<15\\u2192top, 20.4>15\\u2192bottom. Works! Ex1: min(28,19)/2=9.5. All positives (76.5, 24.5) > 9.5 \\u2192 bottom. All negatives < 9.5 \\u2192 top. Works!\\n\\nWhat about threshold = H*W/some_number? Or maybe just a simpler threshold.\\n\\nActually, the cleanest interpretation might be: the absolute values. |product| > threshold means go to bottom if product > 0. Or... \\n\\nHmm actually wait. Let me reconsider. Maybe it's about the DISTANCE from center, not the product. The product approach naturally gives quadrant info. But what if objects TOO CLOSE to the center always go to a specific direction?\\n\\nOr what if the rule is: for each object, check if it's closer to the main diagonal or anti-diagonal of the grid. Closer to main diagonal \\u2192 bottom. Closer to anti-diagonal \\u2192 top. And for distance measurement, use the NORMALIZED coordinates.\\n\\nI already tried this with normalized coordinates and it failed for orange. But let me try with RAW (non-normalized) coordinates.\\n\\nDistance to main diagonal: |r - c| (for square grid). Distance to anti-diagonal: |r + c - (N-1)| where N is grid size.\\n\\nEx2 (30x30, using centroid):\\nOrange(12.67, 12.67): main_d=|12.67-12.67|=0, anti_d=|12.67+12.67-29|=|25.34-29|=3.66. Closer to main (0 < 3.66) \\u2192 bottom \\u2717.\\n\\nFor non-square grids, the main diagonal goes from (0,0) to (H-1,W-1). Distance to this line: |r*(W-1) - c*(H-1)| / sqrt((W-1)^2 + (H-1)^2).\\n\\nThis is getting too complicated. Let me accept hypothesis #2 (product with threshold) and proceed. The threshold seems to be around min(H,W)/2.\\n\\nActually, let me try one more thing. What if the threshold is exactly (H/2 - centroid_r) * (W/2 - centroid_c)? No, that's the same as the product...\\n\\nLet me try: use the TOPMOST cell of the object for position instead of centroid.\\n\\nOrange topmost cell: (12, 13). Product: (12-15)*(13-15) = (-3)*(-2) = 6 > 0 \\u2192 bottom. Fails.\\n\\nWhat about using the cell CLOSEST to center?\\nOrange cells: (12,13) dist to (15,15) = sqrt(9+4) = 3.6; (13,12) dist = sqrt(4+9) = 3.6; (13,13) dist = sqrt(4+4) = 2.83. Closest: (13,13). Product: (13-15)*(13-15) = 4 > 0. Still fails.\\n\\nWhat about the cell FARTHEST from center?\\nOrange: (12,13) and (13,12) both at dist 3.6. Taking (12,13): product = (-3)*(-2) = 6. Or (13,12): (-2)*(-3) = 6. Still positive.\\n\\nI think the product approach works with a threshold. Let me try threshold = sqrt(H * W) / 4.\\nEx2: sqrt(900)/4 = 30/4 = 7.5. Orange product 5.43 < 7.5 \\u2192 top \\u2713. Yellow 20.4 > 7.5 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713.\\nEx1: sqrt(532)/4 = 23.07/4 = 5.77. Yellow 76.5 > 5.77 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713. Red 24.5 > 5.77 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713. Blue -9 < 5.77 \\u2192 top \\u2713. Green -29.65 < 5.77 \\u2192 top \\u2713. All work!\\n\\nSo threshold T = sqrt(H*W)/4. If product > T, go bottom. If product <= T (including all negative), go top.\\n\\nHmm, but this is very specific and might not generalize. Let me think if there's a simpler criterion...\\n\\nWhat about: product > H (or W)? \\nEx2: H=30. Orange 5.43 < 30 \\u2192 top \\u2713. Yellow 20.4 < 30 \\u2192 top \\u2717 (goes bottom).\\n\\nWhat about product > min(H,W)?\\nEx2: min=30. Same as above, doesn't work.\\n\\nProduct > (H+W)/4?\\nEx2: (30+30)/4=15. Orange 5.43<15\\u2192top \\u2713. Yellow 20.4>15\\u2192bottom \\u2713.\\nEx1: (28+19)/4=11.75. Yellow 76.5>11.75\\u2192bottom \\u2713. Red 24.5>11.75\\u2192bottom \\u2713. Blue -9<11.75\\u2192top \\u2713. Green -29.65<11.75\\u2192top \\u2713. All work!\\n\\nThreshold = (H+W)/4. Let me double-check:\\nAll Ex2 positive products: Blue 90.19 > 15 \\u2713 bottom. Yellow 20.4 > 15 \\u2713 bottom. Orange 5.43 < 15 \\u2713 top.\\n\\nThis works! But it still feels arbitrary.\\n\\nActually, I just realized something. Let me reconsider the normalized coordinate approach more carefully.\\n\\nWhat if the comparison uses normalized coordinates differently? Perceiver hypothesis #2 says: main diagonal distance = |r/H - c/W|, anti-diagonal distance = |r/H + c/W - 1|.\\n\\nLet me recompute for orange using the BOUNDING BOX center:\\nOrange BB center: (12.5, 12.5). H=30, W=30.\\nmain_d = |12.5/30 - 12.5/30| = 0\\nanti_d = |12.5/30 + 12.5/30 - 1| = |0.833 - 1| = 0.167\\n\\nCloser to main diagonal \\u2192 bottom according to hypothesis. But goes to top.\\n\\nWhat if it's REVERSED? Closer to main diagonal \\u2192 TOP, closer to anti-diagonal \\u2192 BOTTOM?\\n\\nEx1:\\nYellow: main_d=0.170, anti_d=0.778. Closer to main \\u2192 top? But goes bottom \\u2717.\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nOK wait, I just had another idea. What if for objects ON or very close to the main diagonal, they go to top? And only objects clearly in the UL or LR quadrants go to bottom?\\n\\nLet me define: objects in the anti-diagonal sectors (UR, LL) ALWAYS go to top. Objects in the main diagonal sectors (UL, LR) go to bottom ONLY IF they're far enough from center; otherwise they go to top.\\n\\n'Far enough' could mean: |centroid_r - H/2| > some threshold AND |centroid_c - W/2| > some threshold.\\n\\nOrange: |12.67-15| = 2.33, |12.67-15| = 2.33. Both are small.\\nBlue in Ex2: |5.75-15| = 9.25, |5.25-15| = 9.75. Both are large.\\nYellow: |18.4-15| = 3.4, |21-15| = 6. Moderate.\\n\\nSo what's the threshold? Yellow goes to bottom with offsets (3.4, 6). Orange goes to top with offsets (2.33, 2.33).\\n\\nMaybe: max(|dr|, |dc|) > H/4 or W/4? \\nEx2: threshold = 30/4 = 7.5.\\nBlue: max(9.25, 9.75) = 9.75 > 7.5 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713.\\nYellow: max(3.4, 6) = 6 < 7.5 \\u2192 top \\u2717.\\n\\nDoesn't work.\\n\\nHmm what if |dr| + |dc| > some threshold?\\nOrange: 2.33+2.33 = 4.66.\\nYellow: 3.4+6 = 9.4.\\nBlue: 9.25+9.75 = 19.\\n\\nThreshold between 4.66 and 9.4 for 'bottom' determination. That's around 7, which is 30/4.3... not clean.\\n\\nI think the product approach with threshold is the most promising. Let me try threshold = (H+W)/4 and go with that. Let me verify one more time:\\n\\nEx1 (H=28, W=19, threshold = 47/4 = 11.75):\\n- Yellow product +76.5 > 11.75 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\n- Red product +24.5 > 11.75 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713  \\n- Blue product -9.0 not > 11.75 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\n- Green product -29.65 not > 11.75 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\n\\nEx2 (H=30, W=30, threshold = 60/4 = 15):\\n- Blue product +90.19 > 15 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\n- Yellow product +20.4 > 15 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\n- Orange product +5.43 not > 15 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\n- Maroon product -3.55 not > 15 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\n- Red product -29.33 not > 15 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\n- Green product -86.24 not > 15 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\n\\nPerfect! This works for all objects in both examples. The rule is:\\n\\n1. Compute grid center (H/2, W/2)\\n2. For each object, compute centroid (cr, cc)\\n3. Compute product = (cr - H/2) * (cc - W/2)\\n4. Compute threshold = (H + W) / 4\\n5. If product > threshold: push to bottom edge\\n6. Otherwise: push to top edge\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there's an even simpler formulation... What if we compare abs(cr - H/2) with abs(cc - W/2) and use that to determine if the object is more 'horizontal offset' or 'vertical offset'? No, that doesn't directly map.\\n\\nLet me also try threshold = max(H, W) / 2:\\nEx2: 30/2 = 15. Same result.\\nEx1: 28/2 = 14. Yellow 76.5 > 14 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713. Red 24.5 > 14 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713. Blue -9 \\u2192 top \\u2713. Green -29.65 \\u2192 top \\u2713.\\n\\nAlso works! And max(H,W)/2 is simpler.\\n\\nBut what about min(H,W)/2?\\nEx2: 30/2 = 15. Works.\\nEx1: 19/2 = 9.5. Yellow 76.5 > 9.5 \\u2713. Red 24.5 > 9.5 \\u2713. Blue -9 \\u2192 top \\u2713. Green -29.65 \\u2192 top \\u2713. Works!\\n\\nBoth work because in Ex1, the gap is between -9 and 24.5, so any threshold between 9 and 24.5 works.\\n\\nI'll go with: product > max(H,W)/2. Or (H+W)/4. Let me just use a threshold approach.\\n\\nActually, you know what, let me reconsider whether the product rule even needs a threshold. Let me recompute everything with the absolute PIXEL CENTER of the grid (using (H-1)/2, (W-1)/2 instead of H/2, W/2).\\n\\nEx1: center = (13.5, 9).\\nYellow centroid (5.5, 0.8): product = (5.5-13.5)*(0.8-9) = (-8)*(-8.2) = 65.6 > 0 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nRed centroid (7.0, 6.0): product = (7-13.5)*(6-9) = (-6.5)*(-3) = 19.5 > 0 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nBlue centroid (11.43, 13.0): product = (11.43-13.5)*(13-9) = (-2.07)*(4) = -8.28 < 0 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nGreen centroid (19.0, 3.57): product = (19-13.5)*(3.57-9) = (5.5)*(-5.43) = -29.87 < 0 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\n\\nEx2: center = (14.5, 14.5).\\nBlue centroid (5.75, 5.25): product = (5.75-14.5)*(5.25-14.5) = (-8.75)*(-9.25) = 80.94 > 0 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\nGreen centroid (4.22, 23.0): product = (4.22-14.5)*(23-14.5) = (-10.28)*(8.5) = -87.38 < 0 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nOrange centroid (12.67, 12.67): product = (12.67-14.5)*(12.67-14.5) = (-1.83)^2 = 3.35 > 0 \\u2192 bottom \\u2717 (goes top)\\nMaroon centroid (12.33, 16.33): product = (12.33-14.5)*(16.33-14.5) = (-2.17)*(1.83) = -3.97 < 0 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nRed centroid (18.0, 5.22): product = (18-14.5)*(5.22-14.5) = (3.5)*(-9.28) = -32.48 < 0 \\u2192 top \\u2713\\nYellow centroid (18.4, 21.0): product = (18.4-14.5)*(21-14.5) = (3.9)*(6.5) = 25.35 > 0 \\u2192 bottom \\u2713\\n\\nOrange still fails with product 3.35 > 0 but goes to top.\\n\\nI'll proceed with the threshold approach: product > T where T = max(H,W)/2.\\nFor test cases, I'll compute this carefully.\n",

From the azure center square, emit lines in 4 cardinal directions toward colored rectangles. When a line hits a rectangle's face, it turns LEFT or RIGHT (relative to the facing direction, as encoded by the legend) and continues to the grid edge. If the turned line hits another colored rectangle, it bounces again using that rectangle's turn direction. The azure lines are N cells wide, matching the azure center square's dimensions.\n",

The shapes in all examples appear to be individually connected components (even the azure triangle in Ex1 is connected via diagonal adjacency, but let me verify if 4-connectivity works). Looking more carefully: the azure shape 88./8.8/.8. - the top-left 8 connects diagonally to the 8 below-right, so with 4-connectivity this might be split. Let me check: positions are (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,2),(2,1) - (0,0) connects to (0,1) and (1,0) via 4-connectivity, (1,0) doesn't connect to (1,2), but (0,1) connects to... hmm, (0,1) is adjacent to (1,1) which isn't 8. So with 4-connectivity, this shape splits into components: {(0,0),(0,1),(1,0)} and {(1,2),(2,1)}? That would give us 6 components for azure instead of 3. So we need 8-connectivity. Actually, let me re-check hypothesis 2. But I'll verify in the next phase.\n",
